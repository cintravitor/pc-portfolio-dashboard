## 🐛 Issues Reported & Fixed

### Issue #1: Text Overlapping "Powered by OpenAI" ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Attribution was absolutely positioned at bottom-right
- Long problem descriptions overlapped with attribution text
- Text became unreadable

**Solution:**
- Changed from `position: absolute` to **flexbox layout**
- Attribution now displays **below** the text (not overlaid)
- Added `gap: 0.5rem` between text and attribution
- Text and attribution are now separate flex items

**Result:**
- ✅ Zero overlap - text and attribution separated
- ✅ All text fully readable
- ✅ Clean visual separation

---

### Issue #2: Attribution Cut Off on Right Side ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Attribution text was being cut off at card edge
- "powered by OpenAI" appeared as "powered by OpenA..."

**Solution:**
- Added `padding-right: 0.25rem` to attribution
- Ensures text has breathing room from card edge
- Made attribution `flex-shrink: 0` (prevents compression)

**Result:**
- ✅ Full text visible: "powered by OpenAI"
- ✅ No cut-off at any screen size
- ✅ Right-aligned but with padding

## 🔧 LiteLLM Integration

**Requirement:** Use existing LiteLLM API key instead of OpenAI

**Changes Made:**

### 1. Configuration
```javascript
// Now uses your existing LiteLLM setup:
const LITELLM_API_KEY = 'sk-Cv-XPJMj9Si0Hk8EB2KeLg';
const LITELLM_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://ist-prod-litellm.nullmplatform.com/chat/completions';
const AI_MODEL = 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'; // Via LiteLLM proxy
```

### 2. API Call Method
- **Removed:** OpenAI SDK dependency
- **Added:** Standard fetch API (same as your AI recommendations feature)
- **Compatible:** Works with Node 18+ (native fetch) and older versions (node-fetch)

### 3. Request Format
```javascript
const requestBody = {
    model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.3,
    max_tokens: 150
};

const response = await fetch(litellmEndpoint, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${litellmApiKey}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reuses existing API key (no new setup)
- ✅ Same endpoint as AI recommendations
- ✅ No new dependencies (uses fetch)
- ✅ Consistent with your existing architecture

## 🎨 New CSS Layout

### Before (Absolute Positioning):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Long problem text that might    │
│ overlap with the attri...       │  ← Text overlaps
│ powered by OpenA... [CUT OFF]   │  ← Cut off
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After (Flexbox Layout):
```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Long problem text displays       │
│ fully without any overlap or     │
│ cutting issues now.              │
│                                  │
│         powered by OpenAI ✓     │  ← Clean, separated
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📋 Updated CSS

```css
/* Problem Description Container */
.card-problem-extended {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0.5rem; /* Separation between text and attribution */
}

/* AI Attribution */
.ai-attribution {
    display: block;
    font-size: 0.625rem;
    color: #9ca3af;
    opacity: 0.7;
    font-style: italic;
    text-align: right;
    margin-top: 0.25rem;
    padding-right: 0.25rem; /* Prevents cut-off */
    flex-shrink: 0; /* Always visible, never compressed */
}
```

## 🚀 Ready to Test

**Refresh your browser:** `http://localhost:8080`

**Check for:**
1. ✅ No text overlap with attribution
2. ✅ Full "powered by OpenAI" text visible (not cut off)
3. ✅ Attribution appears below problem text
4. ✅ Right-aligned with small padding
5. ✅ Consistent across all cards

## 📦 Next: Generate AI Summaries

**Now you can run the generation script:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install csv-parse node-fetch

# Run generation (uses your LiteLLM key)
node scripts/generate-ai-summaries.js
```

**Script will:**
- Read all problem descriptions from CSV
- Call LiteLLM API with PM-focused prompt
- Generate 120-char summaries
- Save to `data/ai-summaries.json`
- Show cost estimate

**Then:**
- Review generated summaries
- Edit any that need adjustment
- Run integration script
- Test in browser
