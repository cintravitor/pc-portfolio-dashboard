### AI Chat Example

```
USER: Which products need my attention this week?

AI: Based on current data, here are the 3 products that need 
    your attention:

    1. 🔴 Benefits Calculator (URGENT)
       • Declining UX: 85% → 62% (4 months)
       • 156 users affected
       → Schedule user research session ASAP

    2. 🟠 Onboarding Portal (HIGH)
       • No owner assigned (Development stage)
       • 3.5 HC allocated, unclear ROI
       → Assign owner by Friday

    3. 🟡 Performance System (MEDIUM)
       • High HC (4.2) + manual metrics
       → Plan automation in next sprint

    [View Benefits Calculator] [View Onboarding Portal]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

USER: What's wrong with the Benefits Calculator?

AI: The Benefits Calculator is experiencing significant decline:

    📉 4-Month Trend:
    • UX: 85% → 78% → 71% → 62% (27% decline)
    • Users: 203 → 156 (23% loss)

    🔍 Likely Causes:
    1. New competitor launched 3 months ago
    2. No updates in 8 months
    3. 12 tickets mention "slow performance"

    💡 Recovery Plan:
    1. Week 1: User interviews (5-7 users)
    2. Week 1: Fix performance (<2 sec)
    3. Week 2-3: Ship quick wins
    4. Month 2: Major update

    Similar product (Payroll) recovered using this approach 
    and saw 35% improvement in 2 months.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Is my data safe?
**A:** Yes! Gemini API processes data ephemerally (doesn't store it). No PII is sent to the API.

### Q: What if the API goes down?
**A:** We cache insights for 5 minutes. If API fails, you see cached data + error message with retry.

### Q: How accurate is the AI?
**A:** AI uses your actual portfolio data + proven algorithms. Accuracy is 100% for calculations, and Gemini provides contextual explanations.

### Q: Can I customize what AI analyzes?
**A:** Yes! In Phase 3, we can add custom prompts and focus areas based on your needs.

### Q: What if AI gives bad advice?
**A:** AI recommendations are suggestions, not commands. They're based on best practices + your data. Always use human judgment for final decisions.

### Q: Will this replace data analysts?
**A:** No! AI augments human analysis, doesn't replace it. Analysts can focus on deeper investigations while AI handles routine checks.
