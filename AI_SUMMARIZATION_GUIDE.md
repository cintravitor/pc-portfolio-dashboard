# ü§ñ AI Batch Summarization - Complete Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use AI to generate professional 120-character summaries for all problem descriptions in your P&C Portfolio Dashboard.

**Current Issue:** Some cards have very long problem descriptions (300+ characters), causing visual inconsistency in the grid.

**Solution:** AI generates concise, professional summaries that maintain scannability while preserving key information.

## üìã Files Created for Your Review

### 1. **AI Prompt** (`ai-summarization-prompt.md`)
- Contains the exact prompt sent to AI
- Includes examples of good summaries
- Quality criteria for evaluation
- **üëâ REVIEW THIS FIRST**

### 2. **Generation Script** (`scripts/generate-ai-summaries.js`)
- Reads CSV dataset
- Calls AI API for each problem description
- Generates `data/ai-summaries.json`
- Includes cost estimation

### 3. **Integration Script** (`scripts/integrate-ai-summaries.js`)
- Updates `data-manager.js` to use summaries
- Adds fallback to original text
- Creates automatic backup

## üéØ Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Review & Approve (YOU ARE HERE)

**Review the AI Prompt:**
1. Open `ai-summarization-prompt.md`
2. Read the prompt template and examples
3. Verify it matches your business context
4. Suggest any changes needed

**Questions for you:**
- ‚úÖ Does the prompt capture P&C context correctly?
- ‚úÖ Are the example summaries at the right level?
- ‚úÖ Should I add/modify any instructions?
- ‚úÖ Which AI model? (Recommended: GPT-4o-mini)

---

### Phase 2: Setup & Generate

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install openai csv-parse

# Set API key (choose one):
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."        # For OpenAI
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # For Claude (if preferred)
```

**Dry Run (Test without API calls):**
```bash
# Edit script to set dryRun: true
node scripts/generate-ai-summaries.js
```

**Real Run:**
```bash
# Make sure API key is set
node scripts/generate-ai-summaries.js
```

**Output:**
- `data/ai-summaries.json` with all summaries
- Console shows each summary as generated
- Cost estimate at the end

---

### Phase 3: Review Summaries

**Manual Review:**
```bash
# Open the generated file
open data/ai-summaries.json
# or
code data/ai-summaries.json
```

**What to check:**
- ‚úÖ Length ‚â§ 120 characters
- ‚úÖ Core problem is clear
- ‚úÖ Professional tone maintained
- ‚úÖ Key context preserved

**Edit if needed:**
You can manually edit any summary in the JSON file:
```json
{
  "Solution Name": {
    "original": "Original long text...",
    "summary": "Edit this if needed - keep under 120 chars",
    "length": 119
  }
}
```

---

### Phase 4: Integrate

**Apply summaries to application:**
```bash
node scripts/integrate-ai-summaries.js
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Backs up `data-manager.js`
2. ‚úÖ Injects AI_SUMMARIES constant
3. ‚úÖ Updates `getCardSummaryMetrics()` to use summaries
4. ‚úÖ Adds fallback to original text

---

### Phase 5: Test

**Test in browser:**
```bash
# Server should already be running on http://localhost:8080
# If not:
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Cards display AI summaries
- ‚úÖ Summaries are scannable (2-3 seconds to understand)
- ‚úÖ Grid looks consistent (all cards similar height)
- ‚úÖ No truncation "..." visible (summaries are complete sentences)

---

### Phase 6: Deploy

**Commit changes:**
```bash
git add data/ai-summaries.json src/js/core/data-manager.js
git commit -m "feat(ux): Add AI-generated summaries for problem descriptions

- Generated 120-char summaries for all solutions
- Improves card scannability and grid consistency
- Maintains original text as fallback
- Reviewed and approved summaries"
```

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

**Estimated for ~50 solutions:**

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Total | Quality |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.005 | $0.005 | **$0.01** | Excellent |
| Claude Haiku | $0.01 | $0.01 | **$0.02** | Excellent |
| Gemini Flash | $0.003 | $0.002 | **$0.005** | Good |

**Recommended:** GPT-4o-mini (best quality/cost balance)

## üé® Before & After Comparison

### Before (No AI):
```
Card 1: "The inability to effortlessly track and register the outcome of calibration 
discussions affects directly HIRBPs (and indirectly all Nubankers) as they are not 
able to track calibration conversations and decisions, leading to inefficiencies and 
frustration..." (cuts off, not scannable)

Card 2: "Run surveys easily" (very short, inconsistent)
```

### After (With AI):
```
Card 1: "No centralized tracking for calibration discussions, causing inefficiencies 
and frustration for HRBPs." (119 chars, clear, scannable)

Card 2: "Run internal surveys, such as Engagement Pulse, in an easy and accessible way 
for all teams." (95 chars, clear, scannable)
```

**Result:** Consistent, professional, scannable cards.

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

**If you want to revert:**

**Option 1: Restore from backup**
```bash
# Find backup file
ls -la src/js/core/data-manager.js.backup-*

# Restore
cp src/js/core/data-manager.js.backup-TIMESTAMP src/js/core/data-manager.js
```

**Option 2: Use git**
```bash
git checkout src/js/core/data-manager.js
```

**Option 3: Remove AI summaries section**
Edit `src/js/core/data-manager.js` and:
1. Delete the `AI_SUMMARIES` constant
2. Delete the `getAISummary()` function
3. Change back to: `problem: product.problem || 'No problem statement defined',`

## üìù Example AI Prompt (For Your Review)

```
ROLE: You are a Senior People & Culture Business Analyst at Nubank.

TASK: Summarize the following problem statement in exactly 120 characters or less.

- Make it scannable (2-second understanding)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
{PROBLEM_TEXT}

YOUR SUMMARY (120 chars max):
```

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

**Right now:**
1. **Review `ai-summarization-prompt.md`** (the full prompt)
2. **Provide feedback** on the prompt
3. **Choose AI model** (recommend GPT-4o-mini)

**Once approved:**
1. I'll help you set up API keys
2. Run generation script
3. Review outputs together
4. Integrate into application

## ü§î Questions?

- **Q: Will this change my CSV data?**
  - A: No! AI summaries are stored separately in JSON. Original data unchanged.

- **Q: What if AI generates a bad summary?**
  - A: You review all summaries before integration. Edit the JSON file manually.

- **Q: What if I add new solutions later?**
  - A: Run the script again. It will generate summaries for new solutions only.

- **Q: Can I use different summaries for different screens?**
  - A: Yes! AI_SUMMARIES can have multiple summary fields (short, medium, long).

- **Q: What about data privacy?**
  - A: Problem descriptions are sent to AI API. Ensure no sensitive/confidential data.

3. Any specific instructions to add/modify
4. Preferred AI model (GPT-4o-mini recommended)

**Then I'll:**
1. Update prompt based on your feedback
2. Help set up API keys
