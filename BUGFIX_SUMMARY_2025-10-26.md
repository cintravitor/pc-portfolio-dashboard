# Bug Fix Summary - Dynamic Strategic Filtering
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Issues Reported:** 3 critical bugs  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL FIXED

---

## Issues Reported by User

### Issue 1: Too Many Filters on Insights Tab
**Problem:** All 5 filters showing on Insights tab (including "Owner Name")  
**Expected:** Only 4 filters (P&C Area, Journey Stage, Maturity Stage, Target User)

**Root Cause:** No logic to hide the Owner Name filter on Insights tab

**Fix Applied:** 
- File: `src/js/core/ui/ui-tabs.js`
- Added conditional logic to hide `filter-owner-wrapper` when on `governance-dashboard` tab
- Lines: 47-57

```javascript
// Show/hide Owner Name filter based on tab
const ownerFilterWrapper = document.getElementById('filter-owner-wrapper');
if (ownerFilterWrapper) {
    if (tabName === 'governance-dashboard') {
        // Hide Owner Name filter on Insights tab
        ownerFilterWrapper.style.display = 'none';
    } else {
        // Show Owner Name filter on Explore tab
        ownerFilterWrapper.style.display = 'block';
    }
}
```

### Issue 2: Page Goes Blank When Filter Applied
**Problem:** Selecting a filter causes entire page to go blank  
**Expected:** Filtered governance dashboard should render

**Root Cause:** Async function `createActionLayer()` was being called without `await`, returning a Promise instead of DOM element, causing `appendChild` to fail

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `src/js/core/ui/ui-governance.js`
- Made `updateDashboardSections()` async
- Added `await` when calling `createActionLayer()`
- Made `updateGovernanceWithFilters()` async (to support await)
- Lines: 1334, 1353, 1373, 1381

```javascript
// Made function async
async function updateGovernanceWithFilters(eventData) {
    // ... 
    await updateDashboardSections(governanceData); // Added await
}

async function updateDashboardSections(governanceData) {
    // ...
    const actionLayer = await createActionLayer(governanceData); // Added await
    governanceContent.appendChild(actionLayer); // Now works
}
```

### Issue 3: Console Error - appendChild Failed
**Problem:** `TypeError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': parameter 1 is not of type 'Node'`  
**Location:** `ui-governance.js:1382:27`

**Root Cause:** Same as Issue 2 - trying to append a Promise instead of DOM Node

**Fix Applied:** Same fix as Issue 2 (adding async/await pattern)
