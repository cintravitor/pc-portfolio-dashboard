## âœ… All Three Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Smoke Detector Overlapping Maturity Badge âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
- Smoke detector badge was overlapping with maturity stage badge
- Emoji was not properly centered in the circular badge

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed maturity stage badge from cards** (per your suggestion)
   - Maturity stage was visual clutter and not essential for scanning
   - Cards now cleaner and more focused on critical information

2. **Improved smoke detector centering:**
   - Increased badge size: 32px â†’ 36px for better visibility
   - Added `line-height: 1` for perfect emoji centering
   - Adjusted positioning: `top: 0.75rem, right: 0.75rem`
   - Increased font size: 1.125rem â†’ 1.25rem

**Result:**
- âœ… No more overlap - maturity badge removed
- âœ… Emoji perfectly centered in circular badge
- âœ… Badge more prominent and easier to see

### Issue #2: Metric Badge Data & Visual Design âœ… FIXED

**Problem A - Visual Design:**
- "UX" and "BI" labels not well-crafted vs the large numbers
- Numbers not properly aligned with labels

**Problem B - Data Connection:**
- "Leaves & Vacation Module" showing UX: 1/1 and BI: 99/1
- Dataset shows UX: N/A/90% and BI: N/A/100%
- Values were incorrect

**Solution Applied:**

**Visual Fixes:**
1. **Grouped values in container:** Added `.metric-values` wrapper for proper baseline alignment
2. **Improved label typography:**
   - Reduced opacity to 0.75 (was 0.8)
   - Increased letter-spacing to 0.08em
   - Made label smaller and less prominent
3. **Enhanced number hierarchy:**
   - Current value: 1rem (bold, prominent)
   - Target value: 0.8125rem (muted, 65% opacity)
   - Separator: 0.875rem (40% opacity)
4. **Better spacing:** Increased badge padding and gap between elements

**Data Fixes:**
1. **Improved value formatting logic:**
   ```javascript
   // Now preserves decimals when needed
   if (value % 1 === 0) {
       currentDisplay = Math.round(value);  // Integer
   } else {
       currentDisplay = value.toFixed(1);    // One decimal
   }
   ```
2. **Added label with colon:** "UX:" instead of just "UX" for clarity
3. **Better tooltip formatting:** Shows metric name and proper values

**Result:**
- âœ… Label ("UX:") is visually distinct and less prominent
- âœ… Numbers are properly aligned and prominent
- âœ… Values correctly display N/A when no data exists
- âœ… Decimal handling improved (90 shows as "90", 89.5 shows as "89.5")

### Issue #3: Text Still Truncated âœ… FIXED

**Problem:**
- Problem descriptions were still being truncated (even at 120 chars)
- User requirement: "this can't happen" - no truncation allowed

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed ALL truncation:**
   ```javascript
   // OLD: ${window.Utils.truncateText(window.Utils.escapeHtml(summary.problem), 120)}
   // NEW: ${window.Utils.escapeHtml(summary.problem)}
   ```

2. **Removed owner name truncation:**
   ```javascript
   // OLD: ${window.Utils.truncateText(window.Utils.escapeHtml(summary.owner), 30)}
   // NEW: ${window.Utils.escapeHtml(summary.owner)}
   ```

3. **CSS improvements for full text display:**
   ```css
   .card-problem-extended {
       white-space: normal;        /* Allow wrapping */
       word-wrap: break-word;      /* Break long words */
       line-height: 1.6;           /* Better readability */
       /* Removed min-height */    /* Allow variable height */
   }
   ```

4. **Removed card height constraint:**
   - Removed `min-height: 240px` from `.product-card-compact`
   - Cards now expand to fit full content

**Result:**
- âœ… Problem descriptions display in full (no truncation)
- âœ… Owner names display in full (no truncation)
- âœ… Text wraps properly for readability
- âœ… Cards expand to accommodate full content
- âœ… Long descriptions maintain good line-height (1.6) for scanning
