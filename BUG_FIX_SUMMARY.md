## 🔑 KEY CHANGES

### Bug #4: Automation Logic (CRITICAL)

**Before (WRONG):**
```
Product with 1 month of UX data + 1 month of BI data
→ ✓ Automated ❌ WRONG!
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
Product with 1 month of UX data + 1 month of BI data
→ ⚙ Partial ✅ CORRECT!

Product with 12 months of UX data + 12 months of BI data
→ ✓ Automated ✅ CORRECT!
```

**Classification Rules:**
- **✓ Automated:** Both UX AND BI have 12 months of valid data
- **⚙ Partial:** Some data exists, but not 12 months on both
- **○ Manual:** No data or insufficient data
