## 📝 Dynamic Narratives

### Health Score Narrative Logic
```javascript
if (score >= 80):
    "Strong portfolio performance with well-managed risks..."
elif (score >= 65):
    "Solid portfolio performance with manageable risks..."
elif (score >= 50):
    "Moderate portfolio health with some concerns..."
else:
    "Portfolio health needs significant improvement..."
    
+ "The portfolio includes X star performers and Y products needing attention."
```

### Risk & Opportunity Narrative
```javascript
"The highest risk product is [Name] with a risk score of [X]/10."
+ "Overall, [N] products are classified as high risk..."

"The top performing product is [Name] achieving [X]% target performance."
+ "Leverage insights from the [N] star performers to improve..."
```

### Strategic Alignment Narrative
```javascript
"Resources are heavily allocated to the [Area] area with [N] products ([X]%)..."
+ "while the [Area] area has the lowest allocation..."

"The portfolio maturity distribution shows [N] products in development and [M] mature products."

if (development > mature):
    "Growth-focused strategy with investment in innovation..."
elif (mature > development * 2):
    "Stability-focused portfolio. Consider increasing innovation..."
else:
    "Well-diversified portfolio with both stable revenue and growth..."
```

## 🔄 Integration

### Tab Switching
The Strategic View tab now automatically calls `renderExecutiveView()`:

```javascript
// In switchTab() function:
if (tabName === 'strategic-view') {
    renderExecutiveView();  // Renders Executive View
}
```

### Data Flow
```
User clicks Strategic View tab
    ↓
switchTab('strategic-view') called
    ↓
renderExecutiveView() called
    ↓
window.DataManager.calculatePortfolioMetrics() called
    ↓
Returns metrics object with all data
    ↓
createHealthScoreSection(metrics) - renders health
createRiskOpportunityLists(metrics) - renders lists
createStrategicAlignmentCharts(metrics) - renders charts
    ↓
Each section generates dynamic narrative
    ↓
Charts created with Chart.js
    ↓
Complete Executive View displayed
```
