## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Journey Stage Filter (BUG FIX) ✅
- **Problem**: Filter was incorrectly labeled "Journey Stage" but showed maturity values
- **Solution**: Fixed to correctly filter by `journeyMain` field
- **Now Shows**: Actual journey stages (Start, Adapt, Grow, Exit, etc.)

### 2. Maturity Stage Filter (NEW FEATURE) ✅
- **Added**: Dedicated filter for solution maturity
- **Filters By**: `maturity` field (1. Development, 2. Growth, 3. Mature, 4. Decline)
- **Label**: "Maturity Stage"

### 3. Target User Filter (NEW FEATURE) ✅
- **Added**: Filter for identifying user saturation risk
- **Filters By**: `targetUser` field (Managers, New Employees, All Employees, etc.)
- **Label**: "Target User"

### 4. Improved Filter Layout (DESIGN ENHANCEMENT) ✅
- **New Structure**: 3-row grid layout for better visual hierarchy
  - Row 1: Search box (full width)
  - Row 2: 5 filters in equal columns (Area, Journey, Maturity, Target User, Owner)
  - Row 3: Sort, checkbox, Clear button
- **Design**: Mercury Light design system with glass-morphism effects
- **Responsive**: Adapts to desktop (5 cols), tablet (2 cols), mobile (1 col)

## 🎯 Filter Intersection Logic

### AND Logic (Across Different Filters)
When you select filters from different categories, results must match ALL selections:

```
Area = "HRBP" AND Journey = "Start" AND Maturity = "Growth"
→ Shows only HRBP solutions, in Start journey, with Growth maturity
```

### OR Logic (Within Same Filter)
When you select multiple options within one filter, results match ANY selection:

```
Maturity = ["2. Growth" OR "3. Mature"]
→ Shows solutions that are EITHER Growth OR Mature
```

### Combined Example (Strategic Saturation Risk)
```
Maturity = "3. Mature"
Target User = "Managers"

→ Shows all mature solutions targeting managers
→ High count = potential saturation risk
```
