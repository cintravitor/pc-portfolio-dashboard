**Feature:** Story 6.6 - Objective & Scannable Solution Card Visualization  
**Branch:** `feature/scannable-solution-card`  
**Testing Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Test Environment:** `http://localhost:8080`  
**Tester:** _________________

---

## Pre-Testing Setup

1. ✅ Local server is running: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. ✅ Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
3. ✅ Open browser DevTools Console (F12) to check for errors
4. ✅ Ensure you're on the **"Explore"** tab (Portfolio Overview)

---

## Test Case 1: Information Density & Clarity

**Objective:** Verify all required information is visible without cluttering the card

### Steps:
1. View multiple solution cards on the Explore tab
2. Look for cards with both long and short problem descriptions
3. Inspect cards with and without smoke detector alerts

### Expected Results:
- [ ] **Owner Name:** Visible with 👤 icon, clearly readable
- [ ] **Problem Description:** Extended to ~120 characters (longer than before)
- [ ] **Maturity Stage Badge:** Still visible in header with color coding
- [ ] **Metric Badges:** Two badges (UX and BI) visible at bottom of card
- [ ] **Smoke Detector Badge:** Visible in top-right corner ONLY on cards with issues
- [ ] **Cards NOT Cluttered:** Information is well-distributed with good spacing
- [ ] **Text Readability:** All text is easy to read at normal viewing distance
- [ ] **Consistent Layout:** All cards have similar structure and height

### Notes:
```
[Record any observations about information density or clarity issues]

## Test Case 2: Metric Visualization (Core Feature)

**Objective:** Verify metrics display actual values in scannable format

### Steps:
1. Find cards with **green metrics** (meeting target)
2. Find cards with **red metrics** (below target)
3. Find cards with **gray metrics** (no data)
4. Hover over metric badges to see tooltips

### Expected Results - Format:
- [ ] **UX Badge Format:** Shows "UX [current]/[target]" (e.g., "UX 85/90")
- [ ] **BI Badge Format:** Shows "BI [current]/[target]" (e.g., "BI 120/150")
- [ ] **Current Value:** Displayed in **bold** font
- [ ] **Target Value:** Displayed in **muted/lighter** font
- [ ] **Separator:** "/" between current and target is visible but subtle

### Expected Results - Color Coding:
- [ ] **Green Badge:** Light green gradient background when meeting target
- [ ] **Green Icon:** ✓ checkmark visible in green badges
- [ ] **Red Badge:** Light red gradient background when below target
- [ ] **Red Icon:** ✗ cross visible in red badges
- [ ] **Gray Badge:** Light gray gradient background when no data
- [ ] **Gray Icon:** — dash visible in gray badges

### Expected Results - Interactivity:
- [ ] **Hover Effect:** Badge lifts slightly on hover
- [ ] **Tooltip:** Shows metric name and detailed values on hover
- [ ] **Cursor:** Changes to "help" cursor on hover

### Notes:
```
[Record specific metric values you tested and any display issues]




```

## Test Case 3: Smoke Detector Sign

**Objective:** Verify smoke detector badge is prominent and informative

### Steps:
1. Find cards **WITHOUT** smoke detector badges (healthy solutions)
2. Find cards **WITH** warning smoke detectors (⚠️, count 1-2)
3. Find cards **WITH** critical smoke detectors (🔥, count ≥3)
4. Hover over smoke detector badges

### Expected Results - Visibility:
- [ ] **No Badge:** Not visible on cards with 0 detectors triggered
- [ ] **Warning Badge (⚠️):** Yellow gradient circle, top-right corner
- [ ] **Critical Badge (🔥):** Red gradient circle, top-right corner
- [ ] **Badge Position:** Does NOT overlap with card title or maturity badge
- [ ] **Badge Size:** 32px circle, clearly visible but not overwhelming

### Expected Results - Animation:
- [ ] **Warning Badge:** Subtle shadow, no animation
- [ ] **Critical Badge:** Pulse animation (shadow grows/shrinks)

### Expected Results - Interactivity:
- [ ] **Hover Effect:** Badge scales up slightly (110%)
- [ ] **Tooltip:** Shows count (e.g., "2 smoke detectors triggered - Click card for details")
- [ ] **Cursor:** Changes to "help" cursor

### Notes:
```
[Record which products have smoke detectors and verify counts]

## Test Case 4: Responsiveness

**Objective:** Verify cards maintain layout on different screen sizes

### Steps:
1. Test at **Desktop** width (>1200px)
2. Test at **Tablet** width (768px - 1200px) - Resize browser window
3. Test at **Mobile** width (<768px) - Resize browser window or use DevTools device emulation

### Expected Results - Desktop:
- [ ] Cards display in **multi-column grid** (typically 2-3 columns)
- [ ] All elements visible and properly spaced
- [ ] Smoke detector badge in top-right corner

### Expected Results - Tablet:
- [ ] Cards display in **2-column grid** or single column depending on width
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Metric badges wrap if needed
- [ ] Smoke detector badge still in top-right corner

### Expected Results - Mobile:
- [ ] Cards display in **single column**
- [ ] All text remains readable (no truncation issues)
- [ ] Metric badges stack vertically if needed
- [ ] Smoke detector badge does NOT overlap other elements
- [ ] Minimum card height maintained (no squishing)

### Notes:
```
[Record any layout issues at specific breakpoints]

## Test Case 5: Performance & Technical

**Objective:** Verify no errors and smooth performance

### Steps:
1. Open browser DevTools Console (F12)
2. Refresh the page and watch for errors
3. Apply filters and watch card rendering
4. Expand/collapse area sections
5. Scroll through multiple cards

### Expected Results - Console:
- [ ] **No JavaScript Errors:** Console shows no red errors
- [ ] **No 404 Errors:** All resources load successfully
- [ ] **Success Logs:** Module load logs visible (✅ UI Cards module loaded)

### Expected Results - Performance:
- [ ] **Initial Load:** Cards render in <2 seconds after data loads
- [ ] **Filter Response:** Cards update immediately when filters applied (<300ms)
- [ ] **Smooth Scrolling:** No lag when scrolling through cards
- [ ] **Hover Effects:** Smooth transitions on badge hover (no jank)

### Expected Results - Functionality:
- [ ] **Card Click:** Still opens detail panel on right
- [ ] **Area Toggle:** Expand/collapse still works
- [ ] **Filters:** All existing filters still work correctly
- [ ] **Search:** Card search still works

### Browser Console Output:

## Visual Regression Check

**Objective:** Compare old vs. new card design

### Old Design Elements (Should be GONE):
- [ ] ❌ Colored circles only (🟢🔴⚪) without values
- [ ] ❌ 80-character problem truncation (too short)
- [ ] ❌ Platform and automation info rows

### New Design Elements (Should be PRESENT):
- [ ] ✅ Owner name with icon at top of card body
- [ ] ✅ Extended 120-character problem description
- [ ] ✅ Metric badges with actual values (85/90 format)
- [ ] ✅ Smoke detector badges (when applicable)
- [ ] ✅ Clean, scannable layout
