# Phase 2: Real Metric Calculations - Verification Report

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Awaiting Review

---

## 📊 Implementation Summary

### **New Functions Created:**

#### 1. `calculatePerformanceVsTarget(product)`
**Purpose:** Calculate percentage of months where actual metrics >= target  
**Input:** Single product object  
**Output:** Percentage (0-100)

**Logic:**
- Iterates through `monthlyUX` array, compares each valid month against `targetUX`
- Iterates through `monthlyBI` array, compares each valid month against `targetBI`
- Counts months where actual >= target
- Returns: `(achievedMonths / totalMonths) * 100`
- Handles: N/A values, empty strings, non-numeric values

#### 2. `calculateRiskScore(product)`
**Purpose:** Calculate risk score based on maturity and data completeness  
**Input:** Single product object  
**Output:** Risk score (0-10 scale)

**Risk Factors:**
- **Maturity Stage:**
  - "1. Development" = +4 points (highest risk)
  - "2. Growth" = +2 points
  - "3. Mature" = +0 points (stable)
  - "4. Decline" = +3 points
  - Unknown = +2 points
- **Missing Data:**
  - No UX metric = +1.5 points
  - No BI metric = +1.5 points
  - No UX target = +1 point
  - No BI target = +1 point
  - No owner = +1 point
- **Maximum:** Capped at 10 points

**Risk Classification:**
- **High Risk:** 7-10 points
- **Medium Risk:** 4-6 points
- **Low Risk:** 0-3 points

## ✅ Manual Verification of Calculations

### **Test Case 1: AskNu**

**Product Data (Row 32 in CSV):**
- Name: AskNu
- Maturity: "1. Development"
- Owner: Carolina Junqueira
- UX Metric: Monthly retention rate
- Target UX: 70%
- Monthly UX: [70.2%, 72.2%, 73.6%, 72.4%, 73.4%, 69.5%, 67.8%, 64.8%]
- BI Metric: Domain deflection
- Target BI: 80%
- Monthly BI: [98.0%, 96.4%, 96.0%, 96.1%, 96.0%, 94.4%, 93.9%, 91.0%]

**Expected Performance Calculation:**
- UX months achieving target: 5/8 (70.2, 72.2, 73.6, 72.4, 73.4 >= 70)
- BI months achieving target: 8/8 (all values >= 80)
- Total: 13/16 months = **81.25% ≈ 81%** ✓

**Expected Risk Calculation:**
- Base (Development): +4
- Has valid UX metric: +0
- Has valid BI metric: +0
- Has valid targets: +0
- Has owner: +0
- **Total Risk Score: 4** (Medium Risk) ✓

### **Test Case 2: Ask People**

**Product Data (Row 35):**
- Name: Ask People
- Maturity: "3. Mature"
- Owner: Daniele Nascimento
- UX Metric: CSat
- Target UX: 97%
- Monthly UX: [96%, 96%] (2 months)
- BI Metric: Deflection
- Target BI: 85%
- Monthly BI: [91%, 93%, 93%, 91%, 90%, 91%, 89%] (7 months)

**Expected Performance Calculation:**
- UX months achieving target: 0/2 (both 96 < 97)
- BI months achieving target: 7/7 (all >= 85)
- Total: 7/9 months = **77.78% ≈ 78%** ✓

**Expected Risk Calculation:**
- Base (Mature): +0
- Has valid metrics and targets: +0
- Has owner: +0
- **Total Risk Score: 0** (Low Risk) ✓

### **Test Case 3: M5+ Onboarding**

**Product Data (Row 22):**
- Name: M5+ Onboarding
- Maturity: "2. Growth"
- Owner: Luiza Paganelli
- UX Metric: NPS
- Target UX: N/A
- Monthly UX: All N/A
- BI Metric: % completion
- Target BI: N/A
- Monthly BI: All N/A

**Expected Performance Calculation:**
- No valid data available
- **Performance Score: 0%** ✓

**Expected Risk Calculation:**
- Base (Growth): +2
- No UX target: +1
- No BI target: +1
- Has owner: +0
- **Total Risk Score: 4** (Medium Risk) ✓

## 🎯 Portfolio-Wide Aggregation

### **Calculation Logic:**

1. **Portfolio Health Score:**
   - Calculate `calculatePerformanceVsTarget()` for each product
   - Filter out products with 0% (no data)
   - Average the remaining scores
   - Round to nearest integer

2. **Risk Breakdown:**
   - Calculate `calculateRiskScore()` for each product
   - Count products in each category:
     - High: score >= 7
     - Medium: score >= 4 and < 7
     - Low: score < 4

3. **Target Achievement:**
   - Currently same as Portfolio Health Score
   - Can be refined in future iterations

## 🔍 Edge Cases Handled

✅ **N/A Values:** Treated as invalid, not counted in calculations  
✅ **Empty Strings:** Ignored, not counted  
✅ **Dashes (-):** Treated as invalid  
✅ **Non-numeric Values:** Parsed with `parseFloat()`, invalid if NaN  
✅ **Empty Arrays:** Return 0% performance  
✅ **Missing Targets:** Product excluded from performance calculation  
✅ **Unknown Maturity:** Assigned medium risk (2 points)

## 📝 Changes to `renderStrategicView()`

### **Before (Phase 1):**
```javascript
const dummyData = {
    portfolioHealthScore: 85,
    riskBreakdown: { high: 3, medium: 5, low: 12 },
    targetAchievement: 78
};
```

### **After (Phase 2):**
```javascript
// Calculate metrics for all products
const productMetrics = portfolioData.map(product => ({
    performanceScore: calculatePerformanceVsTarget(product),
    riskScore: calculateRiskScore(product)
}));

// Aggregate to portfolio level
const portfolioHealthScore = /* average of valid scores */;
const riskBreakdown = /* count by category */;
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Open browser:** http://localhost:8000
2. **Load data:** Click "Portfolio Overview" tab first to load data
3. **Switch to Strategic View:** Click the "Strategic View" tab
4. **Verify real data displays:**
   - Portfolio Health Score should be calculated (not 85%)
   - Risk breakdown should show actual counts
   - Target achievement should reflect real data
5. **Check console (F12):**
   - Should see: "Analyzing X products for strategic metrics..."
   - Should see detailed metrics object logged
   - Should see: "✅ Strategic View rendered with real calculated metrics"

## 📊 Expected Results (Based on Dataset)

**Note:** Actual values will vary based on current data, but should be within these ranges:

- **Portfolio Health Score:** 30-70% (many products have N/A data)
- **High Risk Products:** 5-15 (Development/Growth stage + missing data)
- **Medium Risk Products:** 10-20 (Growth stage or partial data)
- **Low Risk Products:** 15-30 (Mature products with complete data)
