## 4. Performance Tests

### 4.1 Timing Measurements
Open Console and run:
```javascript
// Measure update time
const start = performance.now();
// Apply a filter (do this manually in UI)
// Check console for timing log
// Should see: "⚡ Governance update completed in Xms"
```

- [ ] Full dataset (84 solutions) filter change → <500ms
- [ ] Large filter (50+ solutions) → <500ms
- [ ] Small filter (5 solutions) → <300ms

---

## 5. Tab Switching Tests

### 5.1 Filter Persistence
- [ ] Apply filters on Explore tab
- [ ] Switch to Insights → Filters remain
- [ ] Insights shows filtered data
- [ ] Switch back to Explore → Filters still active
- [ ] Switch to Insights again → Still filtered

### 5.2 Clear Filters on Each Tab
- [ ] Clear filters on Explore → Insights also clears
- [ ] Apply new filters on Insights → Explore also filters
- [ ] Verify bidirectional synchronization

## Performance Benchmark Script

Run this in Console to get detailed timing:

```javascript
// Automated performance test
async function testFilterPerformance() {
    console.log('🧪 Starting performance test...\n');
    
    const results = [];
    
    // Test 1: Full dataset
    console.log('Test 1: No filters (full dataset)');
    window.UIManager.Filters.clearFilters();
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    
    // Measure filter change
    const start1 = performance.now();
    // Manually apply filter in UI now...
    // (Can't automate UI interaction from console)
    
    console.log('\nTest complete. Check console for timing logs.');
    console.log('Look for: "⚡ Governance update completed in Xms"');
    console.log('\nTarget: <500ms | Acceptable: <1000ms');
}

testFilterPerformance();
```
