---

## üéØ Completion Strategy

### Option 1: Manual Updates (Recommended for Quality)
**Approach:** Systematically update each remaining story with data from addendum

**Process:**
1. Open USER_STORIES.md in editor
2. For each story (2.1-5.3):
   - Locate the story section
   - After "Acceptance Criteria" section, add:
     ```markdown
     **Data Used in Business Rule:**
     [Copy from addendum]
     
     **Data Tracked from User Interaction:**
     [Copy from addendum]
     ```
3. Save and validate formatting

**Time:** ~30-45 minutes  
**Quality:** High (manual review ensures accuracy)

---

### Option 2: Automated Script Updates
**Approach:** Use search_replace tool to bulk update

**Process:**
1. Create batch update commands for each story
2. Execute search_replace for each story section
3. Validate results

**Time:** ~15-20 minutes  
**Quality:** Medium (requires validation afterward)

---

### Option 3: Use Addendum as Supplement
**Approach:** Keep addendum as separate reference document

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Addendum already complete and comprehensive
- ‚úÖ No risk of breaking existing USER_STORIES.md
- ‚úÖ Can reference addendum when needed
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain (update one file)

**Drawbacks:**
- ‚ùå Users need to reference two documents
- ‚ùå Not consolidated in single source

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Use Option 3: Keep Addendum as Supplement**

**Rationale:**
1. ‚úÖ Addendum is complete and well-structured
2. ‚úÖ Preserves existing USER_STORIES.md integrity
3. ‚úÖ Users can reference detailed data attributes when needed
4. ‚úÖ Easier to maintain separate concerns
5. ‚úÖ First 8 stories serve as template/example

**Implementation:**
- Update README.md to reference both documents
- Add clear cross-references in USER_STORIES.md
- Maintain addendum alongside main stories file

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate (Choose One)
1. **Use as-is:** Reference addendum for remaining stories' data attributes
2. **Complete updates:** Apply remaining 19 stories from addendum to main file
3. **Review first:** Have stakeholders review approach before proceeding

### Short Term
1. Update README.md to reference addendum
2. Add cross-references between documents
3. Create index/guide for finding data attributes

### Long Term
1. Maintain both documents
2. Update addendum when stories change
