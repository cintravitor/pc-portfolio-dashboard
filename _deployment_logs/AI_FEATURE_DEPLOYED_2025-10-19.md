---

## 🎯 Quality Improvements

### Before (Rule-Based)
- Generic recommendations
- Same logic for all products
- No product context awareness
- Basic if/else logic

### After (AI-Powered)
- Context-aware insights
- References specific problems and solutions
- Considers maturity stage and target users
- Expert product language
- Actionable, research-driven recommendations

### Example Recommendation
> "The declining login success rate indicates that our SSO and MFA integration may not be user-friendly for Enterprise IT Administrators. Conduct targeted user research to identify pain points in the current authentication process and iterate on the design to enhance usability and efficiency."

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Analytics**: Track AI recommendation usage and user engagement
2. **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback on recommendation quality
3. **Prompt Tuning**: Refine based on real-world usage patterns
4. **Model Upgrade**: Consider GPT-4o for even better insights (if budget allows)
5. **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Train on historical P&C product data

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Persona Matters**: Enhanced prompt with "seasoned product leader" significantly improved quality
2. **Context is King**: Including problem, solution, maturity, and target user creates highly relevant recommendations
3. **UI Subtlety**: Inline attribution works better than badges/overlays for maintaining clean design
4. **Caching Critical**: Avoids duplicate API calls when users re-open same products
5. **Fallbacks Essential**: Rule-based backup ensures feature never breaks user experience
