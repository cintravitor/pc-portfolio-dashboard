**Story X.X: Clean, Action-Oriented Metrics Section**

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue #1: Recommendation Logic Refinement Needed
**Status:** Non-blocking, scheduled for future iteration  
**Description:** In some cases, the recommendation logic may show fallback messages ("Data is being tracked. Consider setting target values...") even when targets are defined.  
**Impact:** Low - recommendations still appear, just not always performance-based  
**Workaround:** None needed - feature is functional  
**Fix Planned:** Future PR to improve target data detection logic
