## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Pattern: Client-Side Calculation with Pub/Sub

```
User applies filter ‚Üí Pub/Sub event ‚Üí Governance recalculates (client) ‚Üí UI updates
```

**Why this approach:**
- ‚úÖ No network latency (instant updates)
- ‚úÖ Meets <500ms performance target
- ‚úÖ Scalable (can add more subscribers)
- ‚úÖ Maintainable (decoupled components)

### Event Flow
1. **ui-filters.js** publishes `filters:changed` event
2. **ui-governance.js** subscribes and checks if Insights tab is active
3. **data-governance.js** recalculates all metrics from filtered dataset
4. **ui-governance.js** re-renders dashboard sections
5. **AI summary** regenerates asynchronously with filter context

### Performance Optimizations Implemented
- **Debouncing**: 150ms delay on filter inputs (prevents excessive calculations)
- **Pure functions**: All calculation functions are stateless (easier to test, cache later)
- **Minimal DOM manipulation**: Batch updates, reuse existing elements where possible
- **Async AI calls**: AI summary doesn't block UI updates
- **Performance logging**: Console logs update time, warns if >500ms

## Calculations Ported from Backend

All 11 governance calculations ported to JavaScript:

| Function | Purpose | Complexity | Lines |
|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| `calculateSmokeDetectors()` | Warning signal detection | Low | ~40 |
| `calculateBAUAnomalies()` | Resource allocation issues | Low | ~35 |
| `calculateDataHealth()` | Data completeness metrics | Low | ~30 |
| `calculatePTechInvolvement()` | PTech participation stats | Low | ~35 |
| `calculateTeamConsumption()` | BAU hours by team | Low | ~30 |
| `calculatePerformanceMetrics()` | UX/BI achievement rates | Medium | ~70 |
| `calculateStrategicGaps()` | Area/Maturity distribution | Low | ~35 |
| `calculateMetricsCoverage()` | Metric definition & freshness | High | ~110 |
| `calculatePortfolioDistribution()` | Journey/Platform breakdown | Medium | ~70 |
| `calculatePTechByArea()` | PTech by P&C area | Low | ~40 |
| `calculateBAUDedication()` | Top solutions by hours | Low | ~30 |

**Total calculation logic:** ~525 lines of pure JavaScript functions

---

## Data Integrity Verification

### Calculation Accuracy
- All JavaScript calculations are **exact ports** of Apps Script logic
- Same filtering rules (AND/OR logic)
- Same aggregation formulas
- Same threshold definitions (3800 hrs high, 1900 hrs flagged)
- Same categorization logic

### Testing Approach
1. Manual spot-check: Filter on specific criteria, compare client vs. backend
2. Edge cases: Test with 0, 1, and all solutions
3. Performance validation: Measure update time across different filter sizes

---

## Dependencies

### No New External Dependencies
- All functionality uses existing libraries:
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Chart.js (already included)
  - Existing Utils.publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub system)

### Internal Dependencies
- Requires `window.Utils` (Pub/Sub)
- Requires `window.State` (state management)
- Requires `window.DataManager` (data access)
- Requires `window.UIManager` (UI namespacing)

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise:

#### Option 1: Quick Fix (Preferred)
- Identify specific calculation error
- Fix in `data-governance.js`
- Test locally
- Deploy patch (v7.4.1)

#### Option 2: Feature Disable
- Comment out event subscription in `ui-governance.js` (line ~1435)
- Insights tab reverts to backend-only rendering
- Filters still work on Explore tab

#### Option 3: Full Rollback
```bash
git checkout backup/pre-dynamic-filtering
git push origin main --force
```
**Note:** Only use if critical production issue

### Rollback Impact
- ‚úÖ No data loss (client-side only)
- ‚úÖ No backend changes required
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing features

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **No memoization yet**: Calculations run on every filter change
   - Impact: Minimal (already <500ms)
   - Future: Add caching for repeated filters

2. **Full DOM rebuild**: Dashboard sections recreated, not updated in place
   - Impact: Minor (still fast enough)
   - Future: Implement differential updates

3. **No URL state persistence**: Filters don't persist in URL
   - Impact: Can't share filtered views
   - Future: Add URL query parameters

4. **No filter presets**: Can't save common filter combinations
   - Impact: User convenience only
   - Future: Implement preset system

### Not Implemented (Future Enhancements)
- Filter combinations saved as presets
- Shareable filtered view URLs
- Export filtered dashboard to PDF
- Animated transitions between filter states
- Comparison mode (filtered vs. full side-by-side)
