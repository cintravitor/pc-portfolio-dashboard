# Governance Metrics Layout Fix - Deployed

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Deployed to Production  
**Commit:** `4728377`  
**Type:** Bug Fix (CSS only)

---

## 📋 Overview

Fixed the Governance Dashboard metrics cards layout where **USER EXPERIENCE METRICS** and **BUSINESS IMPACT METRICS** sections were not displaying correctly.

**User Request:** "UX and BI should be layered but the card within them side by side"

---

## 🐛 Problem

The metrics cards in the Governance Dashboard had a CSS conflict causing incorrect layout:
- Only 2 cards were displaying per row (should be 3)
- CSS specificity conflict between detail panel and governance dashboard

### Root Cause
Two competing `.metrics-grid` declarations:
- **Detail Panel** (line 2911): `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr !important` (2 columns)
- **Governance** (line 5490): `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` (3 columns)

The `!important` flag was overriding the governance layout.

---

## ✅ Solution

### File Modified
**`src/css/dashboard-style.css`** (Line 2911)

**Changed:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
.metrics-grid {
    display: grid !important;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr !important;
    ...
}

/* AFTER */
#detail-panel .metrics-grid {
    display: grid !important;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr !important;
    ...
}
```

### Strategy
- Scoped detail panel styles using `#detail-panel` ID selector
- Governance dashboard now uses default `.metrics-grid` (3 columns)
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Zero breaking changes

---

## 📊 Result

### Governance Dashboard - Metrics Coverage Section

**Layout:**
```
USER EXPERIENCE METRICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
