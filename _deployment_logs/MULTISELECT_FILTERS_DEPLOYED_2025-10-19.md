## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes
**Before:** Native `<select multiple>` elements (browser-dependent behavior)  
**After:** Custom dropdown components with full control

### Component Structure
```
.custom-multiselect (wrapper)
  ‚îú‚îÄ .multiselect-header (clickable label)
  ‚îî‚îÄ .multiselect-dropdown (expandable list)
      ‚îî‚îÄ .multiselect-option (checkbox + label)
          ‚îî‚îÄ .multiselect-option.selected (purple + white)
```

### State Management
```javascript
multiSelectState = {
  area: Set(['HRBP', 'PATO']),      // Selected areas
  maturity: Set(['2. Growth']),      // Selected stages
  owner: Set([])                     // Selected owners
}
```

### Filter Logic
- **Within same filter:** OR logic (HRBP OR PATO)
- **Across filters:** AND logic (Area AND Maturity)
- **Example:** (HRBP OR PATO) AND (2. Growth)

## üêõ Issues Resolved During Deployment

### Issue 1: Filters Always Expanded ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Native `size="1"` created poor UX  
**Solution:** Custom collapsed/expand behavior with animations

### Issue 2: Text Color Not White ‚úÖ
**Problem:** CSS not applying to selected options  
**Solution:** `.multiselect-option.selected { color: white !important; }`

### Issue 3: Multi-Select Not Working ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Native multi-select required Ctrl/Cmd  
**Solution:** Custom checkboxes, just click multiple

### Issue 4: Filtering Not Triggering ‚úÖ
**Problem:** No event handler on checkbox change  
**Solution:** Added `handleMultiselectChange()` with immediate filtering

### Issue 5: Clear Filters Button Broken ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Wrong function reference (`clearFilters()` vs `window.UIManager.Filters.clearFilters()`)  
**Solution:** Fixed onclick handler in HTML

### Issue 6: ReferenceError ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Line 391 referenced old variable names (`areaFilter` vs `areaFilters`)  
**Solution:** Changed to array length checks
