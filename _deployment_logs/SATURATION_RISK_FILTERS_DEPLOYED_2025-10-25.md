# Strategic Saturation Risk Filter - Deployment Log

**Feature**: Strategic Saturation Risk Filter  
**Version**: v7.3.0  
**Deployment Date**: October 25, 2025, 5:21 PM  
**Commit**: `efb360e`  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

---

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Implemented the Strategic Saturation Risk Filter feature set, enabling PLT members to identify user saturation risks by cross-referencing solution maturity with target user data.

### Core Deliverables

1. **Journey Stage Filter (BUG FIX)**
   - Fixed incorrect mapping (was showing maturity values)
   - Now correctly filters by `journeyMain` field
   - Shows: Start, Adapt, Grow, Exit (actual journey stages)

2. **Maturity Stage Filter (NEW)**
   - Dedicated filter for solution maturity
   - Filters by `maturity` field
   - Shows: 1. Development, 2. Growth, 3. Mature, 4. Decline

3. **Target User Filter (NEW)**
   - Identifies user saturation risk
   - Filters by `targetUser` field
   - Shows: All target user values from dataset

4. **Enhanced Filter Layout (DESIGN IMPROVEMENT)**
   - 3-row grid structure with Mercury Light design
   - Row 1: Search box (full width)
   - Row 2: 5 filters in equal columns
   - Row 3: Sort, checkbox, clear button
   - Fully responsive (desktop → tablet → mobile)

## 🔍 Filter Logic Implemented

### AND Logic (Across Different Filters)
```
Maturity = "Mature" AND Target User = "Managers"
→ Shows only mature solutions targeting managers
```

### OR Logic (Within Same Filter)
```
Maturity = ["Growth" OR "Mature"]
→ Shows solutions in either stage
```

### Use Case Example
```
Area = "HRBP"
Maturity = "3. Mature"
Target User = "Managers"

Result: HRBP solutions that are mature AND target managers
→ Identifies potential saturation risk
```

## 🎨 Design Implementation

### Mercury Light Design System
- ✅ Glass-morphism effects (translucent backgrounds + backdrop blur)
- ✅ Purple accent colors (`#8b5cf6` palette)
- ✅ Smooth 0.3s ease transitions
- ✅ Multi-layered box shadows for depth
- ✅ Hover glow effects

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop (1920px+)**: 5-column grid
- **Tablet (1024px)**: 2-column grid
- **Mobile (768px-)**: 1-column stack

## 📝 Post-Deployment Notes

### Known Considerations
- Filter section is now taller (3 rows vs 2 rows)
- Detail panel positioned lower to accommodate new layout
- All existing functionality preserved and enhanced

### Monitoring
- Monitor user feedback on new filters
- Track filter usage analytics
- Watch for any browser compatibility issues
- Monitor performance with large datasets

### Future Enhancements
- Filter presets (save common combinations)
- Advanced operators (NOT logic)
- Filter analytics (most-used combinations)
- Quick filters (one-click presets)
- Filter export (CSV export of filtered views)
