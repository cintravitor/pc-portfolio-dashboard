## Changes Deployed

### Features Removed

#### 1. Project Narrative Section (Detail Panel)
**Location:** `src/js/core/ui/ui-detail-panel.js`  
**Reason:** Redundant with "Solution Platforms" section  
**Impact:** Detail panel now has 4 sections (down from 5)  

**What was removed:**
- Collapsible section #3 ("Project Narrative")
- Journey stage information
- Platform display (moved to Solution Platforms section)

**User impact:** None - platform info preserved in different section

---

#### 2. Portfolio Command Center (KPI Drill-Down Cards)
**Location:** `src/js/core/ui/ui-insights.js`  
**Reason:** Underutilized feature, streamlining UX  
**Impact:** Executive view simplified, focus on core metrics  

**What was removed:**
- Section "üéØ Portfolio Command Center"
- 6 clickable KPI cards:
  - üö® High Risk Products
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Risk Products
  - ‚úÖ Low Risk Products
  - üìâ Below Target
  - üåü Star Performers
  - ‚õî Critical Products
- `createDrillDownKPICards()` function

**Alternative navigation:** Users can still analyze risk via:
- Risk & Opportunity Matrix (visual 2x2 grid)
- Portfolio Health Score metrics
- Filter/search functionality
- Anomaly drill-downs (Planning view)

   - Clear cache if needed

2. **Quick Smoke Test** (3 minutes)
   ```
   ‚ñ° Site loads without errors
   ‚ñ° Navigate to Insights & Analytics
   ‚ñ° Verify Command Center section is gone
   ‚ñ° Verify health metrics & charts present
   ‚ñ° Open any product detail panel
   ‚ñ° Verify only 4 sections (no Project Narrative)
   ‚ñ° Check browser console - no errors
   ‚ñ° All tabs work correctly
   ```

3. **If Issues Found**
   - Report immediately
   - Rollback available via `ROLLBACK_NOW.sh`
