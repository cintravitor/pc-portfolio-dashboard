HOTFIX DEPLOYMENT: 2025-10-18 18:07:00 -03
VERSION: v6.2.4
TYPE: CRITICAL HOTFIX - Business Logic Fix
ISSUE: Missing metrics counting wrong month + missing N/A key metric check
COMMITS: 2aa954a (hotfix), b8cabed (merge)
SEVERITY: HIGH (Data accuracy issue affecting user decisions)
ROOT CAUSE: 
  1. Used array.length-1 (December) instead of new Date().getMonth() (October)
  2. No validation for N/A in keyMetricUX/keyMetricBI fields
SOLUTION:
  - Changed to dynamic current month detection using new Date().getMonth()
  - Added validation for products with N/A or empty key metric fields
  - Enhanced business rule to capture both scenarios
BUSINESS RULE ENHANCEMENT:
  A product is counted as "missing metrics" if:
  1. The key metric field is N/A or empty (no metric defined), OR
  2. The current month value is missing, N/A, empty, or zero
FILES: 2 modified (data-manager.js, ui-filters.js)
