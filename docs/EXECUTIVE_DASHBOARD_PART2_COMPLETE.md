# Executive Dashboard Enhancement - Part 2: Risk & Opportunity Matrix

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

**Implementation Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Feature**: Interactive Risk & Opportunity Matrix with Scatter Plot Visualization

---

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Created a new, highly interactive visualization that helps executives prioritize products based on a 2x2 risk-opportunity matrix. Products are plotted on a scatter chart with risk on the X-axis and performance (opportunity) on the Y-axis, color-coded by quadrant for quick identification of priorities.

---

## 📊 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Data Manager** (`core/data-manager.js`)

#### New Function: `getQuadrant()`
**Location**: Lines 460-477

**Purpose**: Determines which strategic quadrant a product falls into

**Quadrant Logic**:
- **Star Performers** (Green) - Low Risk (<5), High Performance (≥50%)
- **Monitor** (Orange) - High Risk (≥5), High Performance (≥50%)
- **Improve** (Yellow) - Low Risk (<5), Low Performance (<50%)
- **Critical** (Red) - High Risk (≥5), Low Performance (<50%)

**Thresholds**:
- Risk Threshold: 5 out of 10
- Performance Threshold: 50%

```javascript
function getQuadrant(riskScore, performanceScore) {
    const riskThreshold = 5;
    const performanceThreshold = 50;
    
    const isHighRisk = riskScore >= riskThreshold;
    const isHighPerformance = performanceScore >= performanceThreshold;
    
    if (isHighRisk && !isHighPerformance) return 'critical';
    else if (isHighRisk && isHighPerformance) return 'monitor';
    else if (!isHighRisk && !isHighPerformance) return 'improve';
    else return 'star';
}
```

#### Enhanced Function: `calculatePortfolioMetrics()`
**Changes**: Lines 693-704

**New Property Added**: `riskOpportunityData`

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
riskOpportunityData: [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Product A",
    area: "HRBP",
    maturity: "2. Growth",
    riskScore: 7.2,
    performanceScore: 35,
    quadrant: "critical"
  },
  // ... more products
]
```

**Benefits**:
- One array contains all data needed for scatter plot
- Pre-calculated quadrant for efficient rendering
- Includes context data for tooltips (area, maturity)

---

### 2. **Enhanced UI Manager** (`core/ui-manager.js`)

#### Updated Function: `renderExecutiveView()`
**Changes**: Lines 660-670

Added Risk & Opportunity Matrix as section 2, reorganized sections:
1. Portfolio Health Score
2. **Risk & Opportunity Matrix** (NEW)
3. Risk & Opportunity Lists
4. Strategic Alignment Charts

#### New Function: `createRiskOpportunityMatrix()`
**Location**: Lines 769-818

**Purpose**: Creates the matrix section with chart and legend

**Components**:
1. **Section Header**: Title and subtitle
2. **Matrix Container**: Glass-morphism card
3. **Chart Wrapper**: Canvas for scatter plot (500px height)
4. **Custom Legend**: 4 quadrants with color indicators
5. **Narrative**: Dynamic insights below chart

**Legend Design**:
- Color-coded circles
- Clear quadrant names
- Strategic descriptions
- Hover effects

#### New Function: `createRiskOpportunityScatterChart()`
**Location**: Lines 823-1015

**Purpose**: Creates the Chart.js scatter plot visualization

**Chart Configuration**:

**X-Axis (Risk Score)**:
- Range: 0-10
- Label: "Risk Score (Lower is Better) →"
- Grid lines with 1-unit steps
- Lower values are better

**Y-Axis (Performance Score)**:
- Range: 0-100%
- Label: "↑ Performance Score (Higher is Better)"
- Grid lines with 20% steps
- Higher values are better

**Data Points**:
- 4 datasets (one per quadrant)
- 8px radius (10px on hover)
- 2px borders
- Color-coded by quadrant

**Threshold Lines** (Optional):
- Vertical line at x=5 (risk threshold)
- Horizontal line at y=50% (performance threshold)
- Dashed gray lines
- Divides chart into quadrants

**Interactive Tooltips**:
- Product name as title
- Risk score (X.X/10)
- Performance percentage (X%)
- Product area
- Maturity stage

**Example Tooltip**:
```
Product Name: M5+ Enhancement
Risk Score: 6.5/10
Performance: 42%
Area: HRBP
Maturity: 2. Growth
```

#### New Function: `generateMatrixNarrative()`
**Location**: Lines 1020-1069

**Purpose**: Generates dynamic narrative based on quadrant distribution

**Narrative Elements**:
1. **Critical Products**: Highlighted in red with percentage
2. **Star Performers**: Highlighted in green with percentage
3. **Monitor Products**: Mentioned with percentage
4. **Improve Products**: Mentioned with percentage
5. **Strategic Recommendation**: Based on portfolio composition

**Example Narratives**:

**Scenario A** (More critical than stars):
> **3 products (15%)** are in the Critical quadrant (high risk, low performance) and require immediate attention. **5 products (25%)** are Star Performers (low risk, high performance) and can serve as benchmarks. 4 products (20%) are performing well but carry high risk and should be monitored closely.
>
> **Recommendation:** Focus resources on moving critical products either to lower risk or higher performance. Consider resource reallocation from stable products to critical ones.

**Scenario B** (More stars than critical):
> **8 products (40%)** are Star Performers (low risk, high performance) and can serve as benchmarks. **2 products (10%)** are in the Critical quadrant (high risk, low performance) and require immediate attention.
>
> **Recommendation:** Leverage learnings from star performers to improve products in other quadrants. Maintain current risk management practices.

### 3. **Enhanced Styling** (`dashboard-style.css`)

**Location**: Lines 760-843

**New CSS Classes** (10 total):

1. **`.matrix-container`** - Glass-morphism card wrapper
2. **`.matrix-chart-wrapper`** - 500px height canvas container
3. **`.matrix-legend`** - Legend section with top border
