# Executive Dashboard Enhancement - Part 3: Resource & Performance Allocation

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

**Implementation Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Feature**: Resource Allocation & Team Performance View

---

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Created a comprehensive view that overlays product performance with resource allocation, providing executives with insights into which product owners/teams are delivering the best results. This enables data-driven resource allocation decisions and identification of high-performing teams.

---

## 📊 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Data Manager** (`core/data-manager.js`)

#### Owner Performance Calculation
**Location**: Lines 731-771

**Purpose**: Groups products by owner and calculates average team performance

**Algorithm**:
```javascript
1. Initialize empty ownerPerformance object
2. For each product:
   - Group by owner name (or "Unassigned")
   - Count total products
   - Sum performance scores (only if > 0)
   - Count products with actual data
3. Calculate averages:
   - avgPerformance = totalPerformance / productsWithData
4. Sort by avgPerformance descending
5. Return structured array
```

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
ownerPerformance: [
  {
    owner: "Jane Smith",
    avgPerformance: 85,
    productCount: 4,
    productsWithData: 3
  },
  {
    owner: "John Doe",
    avgPerformance: 72,
    productCount: 6,
    productsWithData: 5
  },
  // ... sorted by avgPerformance descending
]
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Handles missing owners ("Unassigned")
- ✅ Only includes products with actual data in average
- ✅ Tracks both total products and products with data
- ✅ Pre-sorted for efficient rendering
- ✅ Accurate percentage calculations

#### Enhanced Return Object
**Changes**: Line 804

Added `ownerPerformance` property to metrics:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing properties
  ownerPerformance: ownerPerformanceArray,
  // ... more properties
}
```

---

### 2. **Enhanced UI Manager** (`core/ui-manager.js`)

#### Updated Section Order
**Changes**: Lines 664-674

Reorganized sections in `renderExecutiveView()`:
1. Portfolio Health Score
2. Risk & Opportunity Matrix
3. **Resource & Performance Allocation** (NEW - Section 3)
4. Risk & Opportunity Lists
5. Strategic Alignment Charts

#### New Functions (3 total)

**1. `createResourcePerformanceSection()`**
**Location**: Lines 1078-1106

**Purpose**: Creates the resource allocation section

**Components**:
- Section header with title and subtitle
- Glass-morphism container
- Canvas for horizontal bar chart
- Dynamic narrative with insights

**2. `createOwnerPerformanceChart()`**
**Location**: Lines 1111-1241

**Purpose**: Creates Chart.js horizontal bar chart

**Chart Configuration**:

**Y-Axis**: Owner names (horizontal bars)
- Truncates long names to 25 characters
- Gray text color
- No grid lines

**X-Axis**: Performance percentage (0-100%)
- Range: 0-100%
- Steps: 20%
- Label: "Average Team Performance (%)"
- Grid lines with subtle color

**Bar Colors** (Performance-based):
- 🟢 **Green** (≥80%) - Excellent performance
- 🔵 **Blue** (60-79%) - Good performance
- 🟠 **Orange** (40-59%) - Fair performance
- 🔴 **Red** (<40%) - Needs improvement

**Interactive Tooltips**:
```
Owner: Jane Smith
Avg Performance: 85%
Products Managed: 4
Products with Data: 3
```

**Bar Features**:
- 35px thickness
- 6px border radius
- Sorted by performance (best at top)
- Responsive to window size

**3. `generateResourcePerformanceNarrative()`**
**Location**: Lines 1246-1298

**Purpose**: Generates contextual narrative based on owner performance

**Narrative Elements**:

1. **Overview Statistics**:
   - Total number of owners
   - Average overall performance

2. **Top Performer Highlight**:
   - Owner name in green
   - Performance percentage
   - Number of products managed

3. **Lowest Performer** (if significantly different):
   - Owner name in red
   - Performance percentage
   - Only shown if 20+ points below top

4. **Performance Distribution**:
   - Count of excellent owners (≥80%)
   - Count needing improvement (<60%)
   - Percentages for context

5. **Strategic Recommendation**:
   - Knowledge transfer suggestions
   - Resource reallocation ideas
   - Training recommendations
   - Based on portfolio composition

**Example Narratives**:

**Scenario A** (Strong performance):
> The portfolio spans **12 product owners** with an average team performance of **68%**. **Sarah Johnson** leads with the highest average performance at **92%** across 3 products. 
>
> **3 owners (25%)** demonstrate excellent team performance (≥80%).
>
> **Recommendation:** Maintain momentum with current high performers while providing targeted support to teams with lower performance. Continue monitoring and celebrating successes.

**Scenario B** (Performance gap):
> The portfolio spans **8 product owners** with an average team performance of **55%**. **Alex Chen** leads with the highest average performance at **85%** across 5 products. In contrast, **Tom Wilson** shows the lowest average performance at **32%** managing 4 products.
>
> **2 owners (25%)** demonstrate excellent team performance (≥80%). **3 owners (38%)** manage teams with below-average performance (<60%) and may benefit from additional support or resource reallocation.
>
> **Recommendation:** Consider pairing high-performing teams with those needing improvement for knowledge transfer. Analyze top performers' practices and scale successful strategies across the portfolio.

## 📈 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Resource Allocation Decision

**Scenario**: $500K budget to allocate

**Chart Shows**:
- 3 owners with 80%+ performance (green bars)
- 2 owners with 30-40% performance (red bars)
- Green bar owners have fewer products (2-3 each)
- Red bar owners have more products (5-6 each)

**Insight**:
"Top performers are under-resourced, struggling teams are overloaded"

**Action**:
- Redistribute some products from red to green owners
- Provide additional budget to high performers
- Reduce load on struggling teams

### Use Case 2: Performance Improvement Initiative

**Scenario**: Quarterly review meeting

**Chart Shows**:
- Top performer: 92% average (3 products, all in Growth stage)
- Bottom performer: 35% average (4 products, all in Development stage)

**Insight**:
"Maturity stage correlation - Development products need more support"

**Action**:
- Analyze top performer's approach to Growth stage
- Provide Development-specific training
- Assign mentors for Development stage products

### Use Case 3: Team Building

**Scenario**: Looking to build stronger teams

**Chart Shows**:
- Wide performance variance (35% to 90%)
- Hover reveals some owners manage complementary areas

**Insight**:
"Opportunity for cross-functional collaboration"

**Action**:
- Create Communities of Practice
- Pair high/low performers for knowledge transfer
- Establish regular sharing sessions

### Use Case 4: Succession Planning

**Scenario**: Key owner leaving organization

**Chart Shows**:
- Departing owner: 88% average (5 products)
- Next best performers: 72-78% (2-3 products each)

**Insight**:
"Strong backup performers available, but need to distribute load"

**Action**:
- Identify top 2-3 successors
- Gradual transition plan
- Documentation of best practices
- Mentoring during transition

## 🔄 How It Works

### Data Flow

```
1. calculatePortfolioMetrics() called
        ↓
2. Group products by owner:
   - Initialize ownerPerformance object
   - Iterate through productMetrics
        ↓
3. Calculate for each owner:
   - Total products
   - Products with data
   - Average performance
        ↓
4. Sort by avgPerformance descending
        ↓
5. Return ownerPerformanceArray
        ↓
6. renderExecutiveView() renders section 3
        ↓
7. createResourcePerformanceSection() builds HTML
        ↓
8. createOwnerPerformanceChart() creates Chart.js bar chart
        ↓
9. Color-code bars by performance level
        ↓
10. generateResourcePerformanceNarrative() creates insights
```

### Performance Calculation

**For each owner**:
```javascript
products = all products where owner == this owner
productsWithData = products.filter(p => p.performanceScore > 0)

if (productsWithData.length > 0):
    avgPerformance = sum(productsWithData.performanceScore) / productsWithData.length
else:
    avgPerformance = 0
```

**Why filter by performanceScore > 0?**
- Products without metrics shouldn't drag down averages
- Only count products with actual performance data
- More accurate representation of team capability
