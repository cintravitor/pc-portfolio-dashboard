## 🧪 Detailed Testing

### Test 1: Spot Check Metrics (2 min)

1. **Find a product you know well**
2. **Look at its metric badges**:
   - If it has 🟢 green = Check if it's actually meeting targets
   - If it has 🔴 red = Check if it's actually below targets
   - If it has ⚪ gray = Check if it's missing metrics
3. **Hover over the badge** to see detailed numbers

### Test 2: Scan Multiple Cards (1 min)

2. **Notice**:
   - You can see more cards at once (about 75% more)
