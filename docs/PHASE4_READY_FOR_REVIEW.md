## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard
The local server is already running at:
```
http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Sorting
1. Wait for Portfolio Overview to load
2. Click the new **"Sort By..."** dropdown (between filters and Clear button)
3. Try each sort option:
   - Product Name (A-Z)
   - Product Name (Z-A)
   - Maturity Stage
   - P&C Area (A-Z)
   - Owner (A-Z)

### Step 3: Test Combined Filtering + Sorting
1. Select an **Area** (e.g., "HRBP")
2. Select a **Maturity Stage** (e.g., "2. Growth")
3. Choose a **Sort option** (e.g., "Product Name (A-Z)")
4. Verify: Only HRBP + Growth products show, sorted alphabetically

### Step 4: Test Search + Sort
1. Type "M5" in the search box
2. Wait 300ms (debounce delay)
3. Select a sort option
4. Verify: Only M5 products show, sorted as selected

### Step 5: Test Clear Filters
1. Apply multiple filters and sorting
2. Click **"Clear Filters"** button
3. Verify: Everything resets, all products show

Sort By...
Product Name (A-Z)
Product Name (Z-A)
Maturity Stage
P&C Area (A-Z)
Owner (A-Z)
```

### On Page Load:
```
Portfolio Dashboard initialized
✅ Tab buttons initialized
Setting up tactical filters and sorting...
✅ Tactical filters and sorting configured
✅ All event listeners setup complete

## 🎯 Testing Priority

### High Priority (Must Test):
1. ✅ Sort by Product Name (A-Z)
2. ✅ Sort by Maturity Stage
3. ✅ Filter + Sort combination
4. ✅ Clear Filters button

### Medium Priority (Should Test):
5. ✅ Sort by Owner
6. ✅ Sort by Area
7. ✅ Search + Sort combination

### Low Priority (Nice to Test):
8. ✅ Reverse sort (Z-A)
9. ✅ Edge cases (empty results, single result)
10. ✅ Performance with rapid changes

---

## 🐛 Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

1. **Search Delay**: There's a 300ms delay after typing before search applies. This is intentional (performance optimization).

2. **Enhanced Search**: Search now includes the "Owner" field (enhancement beyond original requirement).

3. **Maturity Ordering**: When sorting by Maturity Stage, it uses logical order (Development → Growth → Mature → Decline), not alphabetical.

4. **Case Insensitive**: All sorting and filtering ignores case for better UX.
