# Phase 4: Tactical View Enhancement - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the enhanced Portfolio Overview (Tactical View) with new filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Added

#### 1. **Sorting Dropdown** (`index.html`)
- New `<select id="sort-by">` dropdown added to filters section
- Sort options:
  - Product Name (A-Z)
  - Product Name (Z-A)
  - Maturity Stage (logical order: Development â†’ Growth â†’ Mature â†’ Decline)
  - P&C Area (A-Z)
  - Owner (A-Z)

#### 2. **Enhanced Data Manager** (`core/data-manager.js`)
- **Updated `applyFilters()` function**: Now accepts 5 parameters including `sortBy`
- **New `sortData()` function**: Handles all sorting logic with 5 sort modes
- **Enhanced search**: Now searches in name, problem, solution, AND owner fields
- Exported `sortData` in public API

#### 3. **New UI Function** (`core/ui-manager.js`)
- **New `setupTacticalFilters()` function**: Centralized setup for all filter and sort controls
- **Updated `applyFiltersFromUI()`**: Reads sortBy value and passes to data manager
- **Updated `clearFilters()`**: Resets sort dropdown along with filters
- Uses debounced search for better performance (300ms delay)

#### 4. **Updated Orchestrator** (`dashboard-script.js`)
- Calls `setupTacticalFilters()` in three places:
  1. `setupEventListeners()` - Initial setup
  2. `fetchSheetData()` - After fetching fresh data
  3. `initAutoUpdate()` - When loading cached data
- Removed redundant event listener setup

## Testing Procedures

### âœ… Test 1: Basic Sorting Functionality

**Steps:**
1. Load the dashboard (http://localhost:8080/index.html)
2. Wait for data to load in Portfolio Overview
3. Click the "Sort By..." dropdown
4. Select "Product Name (A-Z)"

**Expected Results:**
- Products should be sorted alphabetically (A â†’ Z)
- First card should start with a product name beginning with early alphabet letters

**Verify:**
- [ ] Sorting applies immediately
- [ ] Cards re-render in sorted order
- [ ] Stats remain accurate

---

### âœ… Test 2: Reverse Alphabetical Sort

**Steps:**
1. From the Sort By dropdown, select "Product Name (Z-A)"

**Expected Results:**
- Products should be sorted reverse alphabetically (Z â†’ A)
- First card should start with a product name beginning with late alphabet letters

**Verify:**
- [ ] Order is reversed from A-Z sort
- [ ] All products still display correctly

---

### âœ… Test 3: Maturity Stage Sort

**Steps:**
1. From the Sort By dropdown, select "Maturity Stage"

**Expected Results:**
- Products grouped by maturity in logical order:
  1. Development products first
  2. Growth products second
  3. Mature products third
  4. Decline products last

**Verify:**
- [ ] Logical grouping is maintained
- [ ] Products within same stage appear together
- [ ] Badge colors match maturity stage

## Console Verification

Open DevTools Console and verify these log messages appear:

### On Initial Load:
```
Portfolio Dashboard initialized
âœ… Tab buttons initialized
Setting up tactical filters and sorting...
âœ… Tactical filters and sorting configured
âœ… All event listeners setup complete
âœ… Dashboard ready
```

### On Data Fetch:
```
Fetching data from Google Apps Script...
Successfully fetched X rows
Processed X products
Setting up tactical filters and sorting...
âœ… Tactical filters and sorting configured
âœ… Data fetch and UI update complete
```

### On Filter/Sort Change:
- No excessive console logs (debounce working)
- No JavaScript errors
- Smooth state updates

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance:
- **Search debounce delay**: 300ms after user stops typing
- **Filter change**: < 50ms to apply
- **Sort change**: < 100ms for datasets up to 100 products
- **Combined operations**: < 150ms
- **UI re-render**: Smooth, no flickering

### Check These Metrics:
- [ ] No lag when typing in search
- [ ] Instant dropdown changes
- [ ] No visual flicker during sort
- [ ] Cards animate smoothly (fade-in)

---

## Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

1. **Search debounce**: There's intentionally a 300ms delay after typing before search applies. This improves performance.

2. **Sort dropdown placement**: The sort dropdown appears after filter dropdowns in the UI (right before Clear Filters button).

3. **Default sort order**: When no sort is selected, products display in their original data order (based on spreadsheet row order).

4. **Case-insensitive**: All sorting and filtering is case-insensitive for better UX.

5. **Multi-field search**: Search now includes owner field (enhancement from original spec).

---

## Bug Reporting

If you find issues, report with:
1. **Steps to reproduce**
2. **Expected behavior**
3. **Actual behavior**
4. **Browser console errors** (if any)
5. **Filter/sort states** when bug occurred

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 is successful if:
- âœ… All 12 tests pass
- âœ… No linter errors
- âœ… No console errors during normal operation
- âœ… Performance is smooth with no lag
- âœ… Filters and sorting work in combination
- âœ… Code is clean, commented, and modular
- âœ… setupTacticalFilters() properly encapsulates tactical view logic

---

## Implementation Notes for Developers

### Architecture:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data operations in data-manager.js, UI operations in ui-manager.js
- **Single Responsibility**: setupTacticalFilters() handles ALL tactical filter setup
- **No Duplication**: Event listeners only attached once via setupTacticalFilters()
- **Debouncing**: Search uses 300ms debounce for performance
- **Immutability**: sortData() creates a new array (doesn't mutate original)

### Key Functions:
- `setupTacticalFilters()`: Main entry point for tactical view setup
- `sortData(data, sortBy)`: Pure function, returns new sorted array
- `applyFilters(...)`: Now accepts sortBy as 5th parameter
- `applyFiltersFromUI()`: Reads ALL inputs including sort dropdown

### Event Flow:
```
User Input â†’ applyFiltersFromUI() â†’ DataManager.applyFilters() â†’ 
DataManager.sortData() â†’ filteredData updated â†’ renderCards() â†’ UI updates
```
