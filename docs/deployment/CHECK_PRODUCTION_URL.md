# Check Your Production URL

## Your Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/cintravitor/pc-portfolio-dashboard

## Likely Production URLs

### If GitHub Pages is enabled:
1. **Main Pages URL:** https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/
2. **Alternative:** https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/index.html

### To Enable/Check GitHub Pages:

1. Go to: https://github.com/cintravitor/pc-portfolio-dashboard/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your site will be published at: `https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/`

## Test Your Changes

Once you have the URL:

```bash
# Open in browser
open https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/

# Or manually:
# 1. Open browser
# 2. Go to production URL
# 3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
# 4. Click product card
# 5. Expand "Metrics" section
# 6. Verify new clean layout!
```

## What You Should See

✅ **Section header:** "Metrics" (not "Metrics & Performance")  
✅ **Subtitle:** "Track performance and take action"  
✅ **No data extraction status**  
✅ **Performance recommendations below each chart**  
✅ **Clean, action-oriented interface**

## Verify Deployment

Run this command to check if Pages is live:

```bash
curl -I https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/ 2>/dev/null | head -n 1
```

If you see `HTTP/2 200`, it's live!
