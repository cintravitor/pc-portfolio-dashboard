## üìã Next Steps - Deploy to Google Apps Script

### Step 1: Open Your Google Apps Script Project

1. Go to your Google Sheet that contains the portfolio data
2. Click **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. This will open the Apps Script editor in a new tab

### Step 2: Update the HTML File

In the Apps Script editor:

1. Look for the existing `Index.html` file in the left sidebar (under "Files")
   - If it doesn't exist, click the **+** button ‚Üí **HTML** ‚Üí Name it `Index`
   
2. **Open the newly created `Index.html`** file in your project folder (the one I just created)

3. **Copy ALL the contents** (Cmd+A, Cmd+C on Mac or Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C on Windows)

4. **Paste into the Google Apps Script** `Index.html` file, replacing any existing content

5. Click the **Save** icon (üíæ) or press Cmd+S (Mac) / Ctrl+S (Windows)

### Step 3: Verify the Code.gs File

Make sure your `Code.gs` (or `GoogleAppsScript.gs`) file contains the `doGet()` function:

```javascript
function doGet(e) {
  // Serve the HTML file
  return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index')
      .setTitle('P&C Portfolio Dashboard')
      .setXFrameOptionsMode(HtmlService.XFrameOptionsMode.ALLOWALL);
}
```

If you need to update it:
1. Click on `Code.gs` in the left sidebar
2. Replace the content with the above code
3. Save the file

### Step 4: Deploy the Web App

1. In the Apps Script editor, click **Deploy** ‚Üí **Test deployments**
2. Click **Select type** ‚Üí **Web app**
3. Configure the deployment:
   - **Description**: `Refactored Dashboard v2` (or any name)
   - **Execute as**: **Me** (your account)
   - **Who has access**: **Anyone** (for public access) or **Anyone with Google account**
4. Click **Deploy**
5. **Authorize** the app if prompted:
   - Click "Authorize access"
   - Choose your Google account
   - Click "Advanced" if you see a warning
   - Click "Go to [Project Name] (unsafe)"
   - Click "Allow"

### Step 5: Test the Deployment

1. After deployment, you'll see a **Web App URL**
2. Click on the URL or copy it to a new browser tab
3. You should see your dashboard loading!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch data"

**Cause:** The Web App URL might be incorrect or not deployed.

**Solution:**
1. Check the `CONFIG.WEB_APP_URL` in the `<script>` section (line 689)
2. Make sure it matches your actual Web App URL from Apps Script
3. Ensure the deployment is set to "Anyone" can access

### Issue: Charts don't load

**Cause:** Chart.js CDN might be blocked or slow to load.

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try a different browser

### Issue: Data looks wrong

**Cause:** Column headers in Google Sheet might have changed.

**Solution:**
1. Check that your sheet still has the same column headers
2. The script expects headers like: "P'n'C Area", "Solution name", etc.
3. Row 1 should contain column headers, Row 2+ should contain data

### Issue: "Script function not found: doGet"

**Cause:** The `Code.gs` file is missing the `doGet()` function.

**Solution:**
1. Open `Code.gs` in Apps Script editor
2. Add the `doGet()` function (see Step 3 above)
3. Save and redeploy
