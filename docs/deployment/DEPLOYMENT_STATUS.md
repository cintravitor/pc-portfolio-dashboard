## 🔍 How to Verify Deployment

### **Step 1: Check GitHub Actions (Now)**

Visit: https://github.com/cintravitor/pc-portfolio-dashboard/actions

**Look for:**
- ✅ Green checkmark next to latest workflow
- ✅ "pages build and deployment" workflow
- ✅ Status: "Success"

**If you see:**
- 🟡 Yellow circle = Still building (wait)
- 🔴 Red X = Build failed (check logs, may need rollback)

---

### **Step 2: Check Deployments (2-3 min)**

Visit: https://github.com/cintravitor/pc-portfolio-dashboard/deployments

**Look for:**
- ✅ Latest deployment shows "Active"
- ✅ Environment: "github-pages"
- ✅ Commit: `5d653c8`

---

### **Step 3: Test Live Site (3-5 min)**

Visit: https://cintravitor.github.io/pc-portfolio-dashboard/

**IMPORTANT:** Do a hard refresh to bypass cache:
- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Or use Incognito/Private mode:**
- Opens fresh without cache
- Best way to see actual deployed version
