   Why it's risky:
   This product is in Development stage with no assigned owner, 
   lacks both UX and BI metric definitions, and has consumed 
   3.5 HC allocation. Without clear ownership and metrics, 
   resources may be wasted.
   
   üí° Suggested Action:
   Assign an owner immediately and define success metrics within 1 week.
   
   [View Product Details ‚Üí]

2. üî¥ Benefits Calculator (Risk Score: 8.7/10)
   Category: Declining Performance
   
   Why it's risky:

USER: What's wrong with the Benefits Calculator?

AI: The Benefits Calculator is experiencing significant performance 
decline. Here's what I found:

üìâ Performance Trend (Last 4 Months):
‚Ä¢ UX Metric: 85% ‚Üí 78% ‚Üí 71% ‚Üí 62% (27% decline)
‚Ä¢ BI Metric: $45K ‚Üí $42K ‚Üí $38K ‚Üí $35K (22% decline)
‚Ä¢ User count: 203 ‚Üí 189 ‚Üí 178 ‚Üí 156 (23% loss)

üîç Root Cause Analysis:
Based on data patterns, the decline correlates with:
1. New competitor tool launched 3 months ago (timing match)
2. Last major update was 8 months ago (feature stagnation)
3. 12 support tickets mention "slow performance" (technical issues)

üí° Recommended Actions:
1. IMMEDIATE: Conduct user interviews (5-7 users)
2. WEEK 1: Fix performance issues (target <2 sec load time)
3. WEEK 2-3: Ship quick-win features based on feedback
4. MONTH 2: Launch major update addressing competitor gaps

Similar products (Payroll System) recovered from similar decline 
by following this approach‚Äîsaw 35% improvement in 2 months.

USER: Why is automation only partial?

AI: The HRBP Dashboard has partial automation because:

Current Data Collection Status:
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ UX Metric: Automated (12 months of data)
‚Ä¢ ‚ùå BI Metric: Manual (only 6 months of data)

The BI metric ($42K business impact) is being manually collected 
and entered monthly. Based on the data pattern, it appears:

1. Data source exists (consistent monthly entries)
2. Manual process is working (no gaps in 6 months)
3. Ready for automation (data is structured)

üí∞ Cost of Manual Process:
‚Ä¢ Time spent: ~4 hours/month
‚Ä¢ Annual cost: ~$2,400 in manual effort
‚Ä¢ Risk: Potential for human error or missed months

ü§ñ Automation Recommendation:
Based on similar products (Talent Acquisition, Performance Management), 
you can automate this by:

1. Connect to existing BI tool API (if available)
2. Set up automated monthly data pull
3. Validate data quality for 2-3 months
4. Estimated effort: 8-12 hours of dev time
5. ROI: Break-even in 3-4 months

The Talent Acquisition team automated their BI metric in 2 weeks.

        timestamp: null,
        ttl: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
    },
    chat: new Map() // Cache common questions
};

// Check cache before API call
function getCachedInsights() {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (aiCache.insights.data && 
        (now - aiCache.insights.timestamp) < aiCache.insights.ttl) {
        return aiCache.insights.data;
    }
    return null;
}
```

#### Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Prevent excessive API calls
const rateLimiter = {
    calls: [],
    maxCallsPerMinute: 10,
    
    canMakeCall() {
        const now = Date.now();
        const oneMinuteAgo = now - 60000;
        
        // Remove old calls
        this.calls = this.calls.filter(time => time > oneMinuteAgo);
        
        return this.calls.length < this.maxCallsPerMinute;
    },
    
    recordCall() {
        this.calls.push(Date.now());
    }
};
