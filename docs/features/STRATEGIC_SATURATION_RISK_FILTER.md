# Strategic Saturation Risk Filter

**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Version**: v7.3.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Priority**: High

---

## üìã User Story

**As a**: PLT Member (Senior Leader)

**I want to**: Use dedicated, simultaneous Multi-Select Filters for Solution Maturity and Target User on the dashboard.

**So that I**: Can quickly cross-reference data to identify clusters of solutions at a high maturity stage that are simultaneously targeting the same user group, allowing me to proactively assess and mitigate the risk of user saturation and over-investment in a single area.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

All acceptance criteria have been met:

1. **Filter Availability & Placement**: ‚úÖ

   - All filters prominently displayed in improved grid layout

2. **Intersection Logic**: ‚úÖ
   - Frontend logic implemented in `src/js/core/data/data-filtering.js`
   - AND logic across different filter types
   - OR logic within same filter type
   - Real-time filtering with immediate updates

3. **Self-Service**: ‚úÖ
   - Multi-select dropdowns for all filter types
   - OR logic for multiple selections within same category
   - Clear visual feedback via filter pills

4. **Scannable Feedback**: ‚úÖ
   - Real-time result count updates

## üé® Design Implementation

### Mercury Light Design System

The filter UI follows the Mercury Light design system with:

- **Glass-morphism effects**: Translucent backgrounds with backdrop blur
- **Subtle purple hues**: `rgba(139, 92, 246, ...)` color palette
- **Smooth transitions**: 0.3s ease animations
- **Hover glow effects**: Multi-layered box shadows for depth
- **Grid-based layout**: Organized visual hierarchy

### Layout Structure

```
Row 1: Search Box (Full Width)
‚îú‚îÄ Search input with icon

Row 2: Main Filter Controls (5 Equal Columns)
‚îú‚îÄ P&C Area
‚îú‚îÄ Journey Stage (FIXED)
‚îú‚îÄ Maturity Stage (NEW)
‚îú‚îÄ Target User (NEW)
‚îî‚îÄ Owner Name

Row 3: Actions & Sort Controls
‚îú‚îÄ Sort By dropdown
‚îú‚îÄ Below Target checkbox
‚îî‚îÄ Clear Filters button
```

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (1920px+)**: 5-column grid layout
- **Tablet (1024px)**: 2-column grid layout
- **Mobile (768px-)**: Single column stack layout
- All elements adapt to full width on mobile

3. **`index.html`** (HTML Structure)
   - Fixed Journey Stage filter (changed `data-filter` from "maturity" to "journey")
   - Added new Maturity Stage filter control
   - Added new Target User filter control
   - Reorganized layout into 3 distinct rows for better UX

4. **`src/css/dashboard-style.css`** (Styling)
   - Converted `.filters-container` to CSS Grid layout
   - Added `.filters-row-search`, `.filters-row-main`, `.filters-row-actions` classes
   - Enhanced `.custom-multiselect` with hover glow effects
   - Implemented responsive breakpoints (1024px, 768px)
   - Improved visual hierarchy and spacing

### Data Flow

```javascript
// User Interaction
User selects filters ‚Üí UI captures selections ‚Üí applyFiltersFromUI()

// Data Processing
applyFiltersFromUI() ‚Üí DataManager.applyFilters(
  searchTerm,
  areaFilters,      // Array
  journeyFilters,   // Array (NEW)
  maturityFilters,  // Array
  targetUserFilters,// Array (NEW)
  ownerFilters,     // Array
  sortBy,
  belowTargetOnly
)

// Filtering Logic (AND across types, OR within type)
filtered = portfolioData
  .filter(searchTerm)
  .filter(areaFilters.includes(product.area))           // OR
  .filter(journeyFilters.includes(product.journeyMain)) // OR (NEW)
  .filter(maturityFilters.includes(product.maturity))   // OR
  .filter(targetUserFilters.includes(product.targetUser)) // OR (NEW)
  .filter(ownerFilters.includes(product.owner))         // OR
  .filter(belowTargetOnly)
  .sort(sortBy)

// UI Update
State.setFilteredData() ‚Üí render() ‚Üí updateStats() ‚Üí renderFilterPills()
```

### Filter Intersection Examples

**Example 1: Strategic Saturation Risk**
```javascript
// Find mature solutions targeting managers
Maturity = ["3. Mature"]
Target User = ["Managers"]

// Results: (Mature) AND (Managers)
// Shows only mature solutions aimed at managers
```

**Example 2: Multi-Selection Within Same Filter**
```javascript
// Find solutions in growth or mature stages
Maturity = ["2. Growth", "3. Mature"]

// Results: (Growth OR Mature)
// Shows solutions in either stage
```

**Example 3: Cross-Filter Intersection**
```javascript
// Complex strategic analysis
Area = ["HRBP"]
Journey = ["Start"]
Maturity = ["2. Growth", "3. Mature"]
Target User = ["New Employees"]

// Results: (HRBP) AND (Start) AND (Growth OR Mature) AND (New Employees)
// Highly specific segment for saturation risk analysis
```

## üìä Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Identify User Saturation Risk
**Scenario**: PLT wants to check if too many mature solutions target the same user group

**Steps**:
1. Select Maturity = ["3. Mature"]
2. Select Target User = ["Managers"]
3. Review filtered results
4. Assess if portfolio is over-saturated with manager-focused mature solutions

**Expected Outcome**: Immediate list of mature solutions targeting managers, allowing strategic portfolio rebalancing

---

### Use Case 2: Journey Stage Analysis
**Scenario**: Understand which solutions impact the "Start" journey stage

**Steps**:
1. Select Journey Stage = ["Start"]
2. Review solutions affecting employee onboarding/joining
3. Cross-reference with maturity to see which are established vs new

**Expected Outcome**: Clear view of portfolio coverage for the Start phase of employee journey

---

### Use Case 3: Multi-Maturity Stage Review
**Scenario**: Review all solutions in Growth or Mature stages for investment prioritization

**Steps**:
1. Select Maturity = ["2. Growth", "3. Mature"]
2. Filter by specific area if needed
3. Sort by owner for delegation

**Expected Outcome**: OR logic shows all solutions in either stage, helping prioritize resource allocation

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Filter Presets**: Save common filter combinations
2. **Advanced Operators**: Add "NOT" logic for exclusions
3. **Filter Analytics**: Track most-used filter combinations
4. **Quick Filters**: One-click presets (e.g., "High Risk", "New Solutions")
5. **Filter Export**: Export filtered views as CSV
6. **Filter Sharing**: Generate URLs with filter state
7. **Filter History**: Navigate back through previous filter states
