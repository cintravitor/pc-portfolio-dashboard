#### Story 6.3: Clear & Unambiguous Filter Labeling with Multi-Select
**As a** User applying filters  
**I want** filter labels to use clear, unambiguous text (e.g., "P&C Area" instead of "All Areas", "Journey Stage" instead of "All Stages", and "Owner Name" instead of "All Owners") AND the ability to select multiple options within each filter  
**So that** I can intuitively understand filtering criteria and efficiently filter by multiple values simultaneously (e.g., view both HRBP and PATO products at once)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 🚧 Filter dropdown for P&C Area shows "P&C Area" as default option text
- 🚧 Filter dropdown for Maturity Stage shows "Journey Stage" as default option text
- 🚧 Filter dropdown for Owner shows "Owner Name" as default option text
- 🚧 All three filters support multi-select (Ctrl/Cmd + Click to select multiple)
- 🚧 Multi-select logic: OR within same filter, AND across different filters
- 🚧 Filter pills display each selected value separately
- 🚧 Clicking X on a pill removes only that specific selection
- 🚧 Clear filters button deselects all multi-select options
- 🚧 Stats bar updates correctly with multi-select combinations
- 🚧 No JavaScript errors or broken functionality

**Data Used in Business Rule:**
- `index.html` - Added `multiple` and `size="1"` attributes to filter dropdowns
- `ui-filters.js` - `getSelectedValues()` helper extracts arrays from multi-select
- `data-manager.js` - `applyFilters()` accepts arrays, uses `.includes()` for OR logic
- Multi-select logic: `(Area1 OR Area2) AND (Stage1 OR Stage2) AND (Owner1)`
- Filter pills: Each selection creates separate pill for granular removal
- Label mapping: "P&C Area", "Journey Stage", "Owner Name"

**Data Tracked from User Interaction:**
- User feedback on filter label clarity
- Multi-select usage frequency
- Average number of selections per filter
- Filter combinations most commonly used
- Time to first successful filter application (expected to decrease)
- Filter usage frequency (expected to increase)
- User errors in filter selection (expected to decrease)
- Support requests about filtering (expected to decrease)

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified: `index.html` (lines 36-38) - Added `multiple size="1"` attributes, updated labels
- Modified: `src/js/core/ui/ui-filters.js` - Added `getSelectedValues()`, updated `applyFiltersFromUI()`, `renderFilterPills()`, `removeFilterPill()`, `clearFilters()`
- Modified: `src/js/core/data-manager.js` (lines 184-208) - Changed params to arrays, updated filter logic
- Modified: `src/css/dashboard-style.css` - Added multi-select styling with visual feedback
- Total changes: 4 files, ~100 lines modified/added

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Multi-select dropdowns expand to 200px height when focused
- Selected options highlighted with purple gradient background
- Hover states for options
- Smooth transitions for expand/collapse
- Filter pills show each selection individually

**Testing Completed:**
- [ ] Local testing completed (10 test cases with multi-select validation)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Responsive design verified (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Multi-select works on touch devices
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Priority:** High (UX Enhancement + Breaking Change)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Version:** v6.2.3 (Patch Release - Breaking Change)  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress (Code Complete, Testing In Progress)  
**Branch:** `feature/clear-filter-labels`  
**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Breaking Change Note:**  
This update changes filter behavior from single-select to multi-select. Users can now select multiple options within the same filter type (e.g., select both "HRBP" and "PATO" simultaneously). This is a significant UX improvement but changes existing user workflows.

---

#### Story 6.4: Visual Feedback for Active Filters
**As a** User applying filters  
**I want** a clear, light visual format to appear on a filter when an option is selected  
**So that** I know immediately which filters are currently being applied, improving comprehension and reducing confusion without being distracting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 🚧 Filter headers display subtle visual feedback when options are selected
- 🚧 Visual feedback is clear but light (subtle border, background tint)

- 🚧 Visual state clears when all options deselected
- 🚧 Works for all three filters (P&C Area, Journey Stage, Owner Name)

**Design Decision:**
- Used `.has-selections` class (distinct from `.active` which means dropdown is open)
- Light purple tint (4% opacity) on background
- Subtle purple border (40% opacity)
- Purple dropdown arrow indicator
- Minimal box shadow for depth

**Data Used in Business Rule:**
- `multiSelectState[filterType].size` - Number of selections per filter type
- `updateFilterHeaderStates()` - Function to sync visual state with selection state
- `.has-selections` CSS class applied/removed based on state
- Visual feedback updates in real-time on selection/deselection

**Data Tracked from User Interaction:**

- Total changes: 2 files, ~30 lines added

**Testing Completed:**
- [ ] Local testing completed (6 test cases covering selection, deselection, multiple filters, clear all)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Responsive design verified (desktop, tablet, mobile)

- ✅ Button positioned at end of filters row with visual separation
- ✅ Purple gradient is lighter and more subtle (Mercury Light theme)

**Branch:** `feature/cohesive-clear-filters`  
**Date:** 2025-10-19

#### Story 6.6: Objective & Scannable Solution Card Visualization
**As a** Portfolio Owner reviewing the Explore tab,
**I want** the solution cards to clearly display objective, essential information (P&C Area, Owner's Name, a fully readable Solution Description, UX Metric & BI Metric last month results vs. target, and the smoke detector sign)
**So that** I can scan the portfolio's health and immediately identify high-priority items or issues that require attention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Each card displays Owner's name prominently with clear icon
- ✅ Problem description extended to 120 characters (from 80) for better context
- ✅ UX and BI metrics display actual values in format "UX 85/90" with color coding
- ✅ Current metric value is bold, target value is muted for visual hierarchy
- ✅ Metric badges use color-coded backgrounds (green = meeting target, red = below, gray = no data)
- ✅ Smoke detector badge appears in top-right corner when issues detected
- ✅ Smoke detector shows 🔥 for critical (≥3 detectors) or ⚠️ for warning (<3 detectors)
- ✅ Smoke detector badge only visible when count > 0
- ✅ All information is scannable without cluttering the card
- ✅ Cards maintain consistent height for clean grid layout
- ✅ P&C Area remains in section headers (not duplicated on cards)

**Design Decisions (UX Expert Recommendations):**
- **Problem over Solution:** Display "Which Problem it Solves" field (more valuable for scanning) rather than solution description
- **Extended Context:** 120-character limit provides sufficient context without requiring drill-down
- **Actual Values:** Metric badges show "85/90" format instead of just colored circles for clarity
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Bold current value + muted target + color background creates scannable format
- **Alert Prominence:** Smoke detector badge positioned top-right with pulse animation for critical issues
- **Information Density:** All essential data visible without overwhelming the user

**Data Used in Business Rule:**
- `product.owner` - Owner's Name (displayed with 👤 icon)
- `product.problem` - Problem statement (truncated to 120 chars)
- `summary.uxValue` - Current UX metric value
- `summary.uxTarget` - Target UX metric value
- `summary.uxStatus` - UX status ('green', 'red', 'gray')
- `summary.uxMetric` - UX metric name (for tooltip)
- `summary.biValue` - Current BI metric value
- `summary.biTarget` - Target BI metric value
- `summary.biStatus` - BI status ('green', 'red', 'gray')
- `summary.biMetric` - BI metric name (for tooltip)
- `calculateSmokeDetectors(product)` - Count of triggered smoke detectors (0-4)
- Badge severity: count ≥ 3 = 'critical', count < 3 = 'warning'

**Data Tracked from User Interaction:**
- User feedback on card scannability
- Time to identify high-priority items (expected to decrease)
- Smoke detector badge interactions (hovers, clicks)
- Metric badge hover events (tooltip views)
- Card comprehension without drill-down (expected to increase)
- Visual clarity satisfaction ratings
