# Full-Screen Detail Panel

## Overview
The solution detail panel displays as a centered, full-screen modal overlay with a liquid glass frosted background effect, providing a focused comparison view of solution metrics and core details.

## Layout Structure
- **Modal Overlay**: Fixed full-screen backdrop with blur effect
- **Modal Content**: Centered container (90% width, max 1400px, 85vh height)
- **Side-by-Side Layout**: 50/50 split between Metrics and Core Details
- **Collapsible Sections**: Both sections start collapsed

## Interaction Patterns
- **Open**: Click any solution card
- **Close**: Click X button, click backdrop, or press ESC key
- **Expand Section**: Click section header to toggle
- **Zero-Scroll**: Modal and page don't scroll; expanded sections scroll internally if needed

## Technical Implementation
- **HTML**: `index.html` - Modal overlay wrapper structure
- **CSS**: `src/css/dashboard-style.css` - Liquid glass styling, grid layout
- **JS**: `src/js/core/ui/ui-detail-panel.js` - Rendering and event handling

## Design System
- Uses `--glass-bg` and `backdrop-filter` from Mercury Light theme
- Follows Modal/Drill-Down Pattern structure
- Typography: `--text-*` scale with rem-based spacing

## Key Features

### Liquid Glass Styling
The modal uses a sophisticated glass morphism effect:
- Frosted background with `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`
- Semi-transparent white background
- Layered shadows for depth
- Backdrop overlay with blur to obscure underlying content

### Comparison Layout
Two equal-width columns allow direct comparison:
- **Left Column**: Metrics section with UX and BI performance charts
- **Right Column**: Core Details with ownership and strategic context

### Zero-Scroll Design
The modal implements intelligent scrolling:
- Modal itself is fixed and doesn't scroll
- Page behind modal is locked (no scroll)
- Individual expanded sections have internal scrolling
- Maximum section height calculated based on viewport

### Multiple Close Methods
User can close the modal via:
1. Close button (X) in the header
2. Clicking outside the modal (backdrop)
3. Pressing ESC key

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (>1024px)
- Side-by-side layout maintained
- Modal: 90% width, max 1400px
- 2rem padding around modal

### Tablet/Mobile (â‰¤1024px)
- Sections stack vertically
- Modal: 95% width
- 1rem padding around modal

## Accessibility
- ARIA label on close button
- Keyboard navigation (ESC to close)
- Focus management
- Proper semantic HTML structure

## Performance Considerations
- Event listeners properly cleaned up on close
- Chart instances destroyed to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- CSS animations use GPU acceleration
