# üß™ Hotfix Testing Guide - v6.2.4

**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Hotfix:** Missing Metrics Business Logic Fix  
**Type:** Critical - Data Accuracy Issue  
**Risk:** LOW (Targeted fix, no breaking changes)

---

## üìã WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Issue:**
The "UX Metrics not updated" and "BI Metrics not updated" stat cards were checking the **last month of the year (December)** instead of the **current month (October)**.

### **Root Cause:**
Business logic was using `array.length - 1` (always gets index 11 = December) instead of `new Date().getMonth()` (gets current month index, e.g., October = 9).

### **Enhancement:**
Also added logic to count products with "N/A" in the key metric field itself as missing metrics (no metric defined).

### **Updated Business Rule:**
A product is counted as "missing metrics" if:
1. The key metric field itself is "N/A" or empty (`keyMetricUX` or `keyMetricBI`), **OR**
2. The current month's metric value is missing, "N/A", empty, or zero

### **Files Modified:**
1. `src/js/core/data-manager.js` - `countMissingMetrics()` function
2. `src/js/core/ui/ui-filters.js` - `filterByMissingMetric()` function

## üß™ MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST

### **Test Environment:**
- Local server: http://localhost:8080
- Branch: `hotfix/fix-missing-metrics-month`
- Current month: October 2025 (index 9)

### **Test Case 1: Verify Metric Counts (Primary)**

**Objective:** Ensure stat cards show correct counts for October data

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1  | Open http://localhost:8080 | Dashboard loads successfully | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 1.2  | Navigate to "Explore" tab | Portfolio Overview visible | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 1.3  | Observe "‚ö†Ô∏è UX Metrics not updated" card | Shows count = (Total - Products with Oct UX data) | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Should be 82 per user report |
| 1.4  | Observe "‚ö†Ô∏è BI Metrics not updated" card | Shows count = (Total - Products with Oct BI data) | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Should be 82 per user report |
| 1.5  | Observe "Total Solutions" card | Shows 84 total | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | From user report |
| 1.6  | Calculate UX: 84 - (UX count) | Should equal ~2 products with Oct UX data | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Per user report |
| 1.7  | Calculate BI: 84 - (BI count) | Should equal ~2 products with Oct BI data | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Per user report |

**Result:** [ ] ALL PASS / [ ] FAILURES DETECTED

**Before Fix (Expected):**
- Showing incorrect counts (checking December instead of October)

**After Fix (Expected):**
- UX Metrics not updated: 82 (84 total - 2 with October UX data)
- BI Metrics not updated: 82 (84 total - 2 with October BI data)

### **Test Case 2: Click-to-Filter Functionality**

**Objective:** Ensure clicking stat cards filters correct products

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 2.1  | Click "‚ö†Ô∏è UX Metrics not updated" card | Page filters to show only products missing Oct UX data | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.2  | Check filtered products count | Matches the stat card count (should be 82) | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.3  | Verify filter notification appears | Shows message about UX metrics filter | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.4  | Click "Clear Filters" button | Returns to all 84 products | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.5  | Click "‚ö†Ô∏è BI Metrics not updated" card | Page filters to show only products missing Oct BI data | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.6  | Check filtered products count | Matches the stat card count (should be 82) | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.7  | Verify filter notification appears | Shows message about BI metrics filter | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 2.8  | Click "Clear Filters" button | Returns to all 84 products | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |

**Result:** [ ] ALL PASS / [ ] FAILURES DETECTED

### **Test Case 3: Console Error Check**

**Objective:** Ensure no JavaScript errors introduced

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 3.1  | Open DevTools (F12) | Console opens | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 3.2  | Refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R) | No errors on load | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 3.3  | Click "UX Metrics not updated" card | No errors when filtering | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 3.4  | Click "BI Metrics not updated" card | No errors when filtering | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 3.5  | Click "Clear Filters" | No errors when clearing | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |
| 3.6  | Check for any warnings | Only expected warnings (if any) | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | |

### **Test Case 4: Verify Logic with Sample Data**

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 4.1  | Pick a product with Oct UX data (from spreadsheet) | Product should NOT be in "UX Metrics not updated" filter | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Product name: _____ |
| 4.2  | Pick a product WITHOUT Oct UX data (from spreadsheet) | Product SHOULD be in "UX Metrics not updated" filter | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | Product name: _____ |
